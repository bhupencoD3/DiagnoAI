# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community
include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility for our own speech and our own actions
* Recognizing that the medical AI domain requires extra sensitivity to ethical concerns
* Participating in discussions with a focus on educational value and safety

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, and reject
comments, commits, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include posting in an official
DiagnoAI account, wearing a DiagnoAI-branded shirt at an industry event, or
mentioning your contribution in a blog post or social media.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[bhupenparmar.ds@gmail.com](mailto:bhupenparmar.ds@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders are responsible for determining who meets the criteria for
enforcement and the appropriate consequences. However, they must uphold the
following, at a minimum:

* Distinguish between protected characteristics under this Code of Conduct and
  those not protected by this Code of Conduct.
* Use the [DiagnoAI Enforcement Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#enforcement-guidelines) for guidance.
