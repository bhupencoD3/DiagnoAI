It is rare, but serious. It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But it is different from polio . AFM is not caused by polioviruses. What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? AFM can be caused by several different viruses. Researchers think that enteroviruses have been causing the recent increases in the number of children with AFM. AFM can also be caused by other viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses. Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection ) before they got AFM. Who is more likely to develop acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children. What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Most people with AFM will suddenly have: Arm or leg weakness A loss of muscle tone and reflexes Some people also have other symptoms, including: Facial drooping/weakness Trouble moving the eyes Drooping eyelids Trouble swallowing Slurred speech Pain in the arms, legs, back, or neck Sometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure , which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe. If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, get medical care right away. How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed? AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome . This can make it difficult to diagnose. To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use: A neurologic exam , including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes An MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain Lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord) Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies . These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start. What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people who get AFM. Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented? There is no specific way to prevent AFM. But you can take steps to prevent getting sick from a virus by: Washing your hands often with soap and water Avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands Staying home when sick Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 537, "char_count": 3225, "synonyms": ["AFM"], "mesh_terms": [], "search_terms": ["acute flaccid myelitis", "afm"], "quality_score": 55.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/acuteflaccidmyelitis.html"},

Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of acute leukemia. It's also called ALL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \"Acute\" means that it usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children . It can also affect adults. In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. These cells normally help your body fight infection. But in ALL, they are abnormal and cannot fight infection very well. They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia , and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. What causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? ALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise your risk of ALL. Who is at risk for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? The factors that raise your risk of ALL include: Being male Being white Being over age 70 Having had chemotherapy or radiation therapy Having been exposed to high levels of radiation Having certain genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome What are the symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? The signs and symptoms of ALL include: Weakness or feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Shortness of breath Weight loss or loss of appetite Pain in the bones or stomach Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Having had many infections How is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose ALL and figure out which subtype you have: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as Complete blood count (CBC) with differential Blood chemistry tests such as a basic metabolic panel (BMP) , comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , kidney function tests , liver function tests , and electrolyte panel Blood smear Bone marrow tests . There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes If you are diagnosed with ALL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture , which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What are the treatments for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? Treatments for ALL include: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Treatment is usually done in two phases: The goal of the first phase is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This treatment puts the leukemia into remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared. The second phase is known as post-remission therapy. Its goal is to prevent a relapse (return) of the cancer. It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow. Treatment during both phases also usually includes central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis therapy. This therapy helps prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord. It may be high dose chemotherapy or chemotherapy injected into the spinal cord. It also sometimes includes radiation therapy.

They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose. Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs. What are enlarged adenoids? Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children. What causes enlarged adenoids? Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone. What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?

The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection. In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy. What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one? An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if: Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear. Taking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids. The enlarged adenoids block the airways.

When you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body. There are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including: Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous. Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1) . In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH. People born with CAH may not have symptoms until childhood or later in life. What causes adrenal gland disorders? The cause of adrenal gland disorders depends on the type of disorder you have. Causes can include: Medicines such as steroids A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary gland . The pituitary gland releases hormones that affect how the adrenal glands work. Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones. Infections In many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear. How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed? Health care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history. For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays , CT scans , or MRI scans to look for tumors.

Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. AUD is a disease that causes: Craving - a strong need to drink Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one. What are the dangers of too much alcohol? Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases , such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis . It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your fetus . Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide. How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions: In the past year, have you: Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to? Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't? Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking? Felt a strong need to drink? Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school? Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink? Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex. Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem? Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol? Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety , depression , restlessness, nausea , and sweating . In severe cases, you could have a fever , seizures , or hallucinations. If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is. What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan , prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.

An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is drinking that causes distress and harm. It is a medical condition in which you: Drink alcohol compulsively Can't control how much you drink Feel anxious, irritable, and/or stressed when you are not drinking An AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. What are the treatments for alcohol use disorder? Most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people, using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness, it is important to get treatment for both. Some people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD. Which medicines can treat alcohol use disorder? Three medicines are approved to treat AUD: Disulfiram causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol. Naltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking. Acamprosate helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking. Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes. Which behavioral therapies can treat alcohol use disorder? Another name for behavioral therapies for AUD is alcohol counseling. It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups. Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan. Marital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking. Brief interventions are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change. Is treatment for alcohol use disorder effective? For most people, treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills. This may help you be more successful the next time.

Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects thinking and memory skills. If you have AD, it can impair your ability to reason or learn new skills until it becomes difficult to complete daily activities. AD begins slowly over many years. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It may be mistaken for normal memory changes with aging. However, AD is not a normal part of aging. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time. What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? People with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day. AD progresses in stages. Late-onset AD occurs in adults aged 65 and older, which is when most people develop the disease. Early-onset AD happens before age 65, which is not common. Some symptoms of AD can include: Getting lost in familiar places Repeating the same question Not recognizing family members Having trouble speaking, reading, or writing Not taking care of yourself, such as not bathing or eating poorly In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. Later on, people with AD may become anxious or aggressive or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them. Who is more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease? Researchers don't fully understand what causes AD. Age is the biggest risk factor. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. Although people who develop Alzheimer's don't always have a history of the disease in their families. Researchers believe the causes of AD may be a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, health, and lifestyle factors. Some medical conditions that are associated with a higher risk of AD include: Hearing loss Depression Mild cognitive impairment Concussion or other traumatic brain injury (TBI) A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD. How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed? Some health conditions can cause memory loss or symptoms like AD. Talk with your health care provider if you're having noticeable changes in your memory. To determine if your symptoms are related to AD and not normal aging or another health condition, your provider may: Review your medical history and any medicines you're taking Conduct tests to check your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills Ask about changes in behavior or personality Do tests to rule out any medical or mental health conditions Refer you to a provider that specializes in caring for older adults Recommend a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system What are the treatments for Alzheimer's disease? No treatment can stop the disease. However, some medicines may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?

Anesthesia is the use of medicines, called anesthetics, to prevent pain during surgery and other medical procedures. Medicine may be given by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or a skin patch. Anesthesia can cause a loss of feeling, awareness, or both. Sedation may be used with anesthesia. Unlike full anesthesia, sedation doesn't make you completely unconscious, and recovery is faster. It helps reduce pain, keep you calm, and make you less aware during procedures such as minor surgeries, endoscopies , imaging , or dental work. Levels of sedation include: Minimal sedation. You are awake but more relaxed. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation). You may feel sleepy and not remember much, but you can still respond when spoken to or touched. Deep sedation. You are very drowsy and may respond only to repeated or stronger stimulation. What is anesthesia used for? Anesthesia may be used for: Minor procedures, such as filling a tooth. Childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies . Minor and major surgeries. In some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia. What are the types of anesthesia? There are several different types of anesthesia: Local anesthesia numbs a small area like a tooth or a cut that needs stitches. You are awake during local anesthesia. Regional anesthesia numbs a larger area, like an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. It may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries. General anesthesia affects your whole body. It feels like a deep sleep, but you do not feel anything. It is used during major surgeries, such as heart surgery , brain surgery, back surgery, and organ transplants . Monitored sedation makes you relaxed or sleepy. You may be able to talk, depending on the level of sedation, and you probably won't remember the procedure. It may be used for a colonoscopy or dental work. Your overall health, medical history, the procedure you're having, and other factors will help determine the type of anesthesia you receive. What are the risks of anesthesia? Anesthesia is generally safe. But there can be risks, especially with general anesthesia, including: Heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia). Breathing problems. An allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Temporary confusion ( delirium ), which can last several days in some people over the age of 60, or briefly in children after waking up from anesthesia.

Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease , a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol , calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). What conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to: Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina . There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack . In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment. Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages , you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise . What happens during angioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will: Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays. Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming. What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots . Most people can return to their usual activities after a week. If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days. Are there any risks from angioplasty? Angioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise , feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding , blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.

It causes inflammation (swelling) between your vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) and the joints between your spine and pelvis. AS inflammation can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend. Symptoms of AS can range from mild to severe back pain. Over time, AS can fuse (grow together) your vertebrae, limiting movement and causing a hunched posture. In some people, AS can affect other joints or body parts. There is no cure for AS, but early treatment can help manage symptoms, slow down the disease, and help you lead a more productive life. Who is more likely to get ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis usually starts before age 45. Early symptoms may begin between the ages of 15 and 30. Your chance of developing AS can also increase if: You're a man. AS is more common and severe in men. You have a family history. If a member of your family has AS, you're more likely to get the disease. You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting AS. These include Crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , or psoriasis . What causes ankylosing spondylitis? No one knows what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but the environment and genes likely play a role. Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting the disease, but not everyone with these genes gets AS. What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? AS affects people differently. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the lower back and/or hips. The pain is usually worse during the night or after sitting for a long time. Over time, AS may progress to other areas of your spine or body. Symptoms may depend on which areas of your body the disease affects. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others may have severe, ongoing pain. Other symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis may include: Pain, stiffness, and inflammation of the joints. Difficulty taking a deep breath. This could occur if the joints connecting the ribs are affected. Changes in vision. Fatigue . Loss of appetite. Weight loss. Skin rashes, such as psoriasis. Abdominal (belly) pain and loose stools (poop). How is ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed? There is no single test for ankylosing spondylitis.

What is antibiotic resistance? Antibiotic resistance happens when bacteria change and can resist the effects of an antibiotic. The bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. The infections these bacteria cause are called resistant infections. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. In some cases, they can even be deadly. Antibiotic resistance does not mean that your body is resistant to antibiotics. There are many different types of resistant infections. They include MRSA and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB).

There are other types; viruses , fungi , and parasites can also become resistant to medicines. How do bacteria become resistant to antibiotics? Antibiotic resistance is a natural process that happens over time. To survive, bacteria can develop defense strategies against antibiotics. This happens through genetic changes in the bacteria. These resistant bacteria survive, grow, and spread. Each time you take antibiotics, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant. So it is important to only take antibiotics when you really need them. They won't work on viral infections such as colds and the flu . And you don't need antibiotics for every bacterial infection.

It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming. What are anxiety disorders? Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships. What are the types of anxiety disorders? There are several types of anxiety disorders, including: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months. Panic disorder . People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more. Phobias . People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety). What causes anxiety disorders? The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress , and your environment may play a role. Who is at risk for anxiety disorders? The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including: Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders? The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of: Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time. Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness , and shortness of breath Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do Using caffeine , other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse. How are anxiety disorders diagnosed? To diagnose anxiety disorders, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may also have a physical exam and lab tests to make sure that a different health problem is not the cause of your symptoms. If you don't have another health problem, you will get a psychological evaluation . Your provider may do it, or you may be referred to a mental health professional to get one. What are the treatments for anxiety disorders? The main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both: Psychotherapy can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. To be effective, it should focus on your specific anxieties and needs. There are many types; some of the types used for anxiety disorders include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This therapy focuses on having you confront your fears so that you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding. Acceptance and commitment therapy may help with some anxiety disorders. It uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce discomfort and anxiety. Medicines to treat anxiety disorders include anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants . Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your provider to identify which medicine is best for you. You may need to try more than one medicine before you can find the right one. Support groups and stress management techniques may also be helpful.

Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language. The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia: Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean. Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events. In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from: Stroke , which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor Brain infection or inflammation Brain injury Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia Who is more likely to develop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How is aphasia diagnosed? If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually: Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands. Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include: MRI CT scan If imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders ). What are the treatments for aphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as: Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly Language abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak. How much a person recovers depends on many things, including: What caused the brain injury What part of the brain was hurt How badly and how much of the brain was hurt The age and health of the person Can aphasia be prevented? You can help prevent aphasia by: Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having: A stroke Heart disease Vascular disease (problems with your blood vessels) Protecting your brain from injury: Wearing the right helmet for sports safety , such as when riding a bike Taking action to prevent falls Always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 689, "char_count": 4104, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Aphasia"], "search_terms": ["aphasia"], "quality_score": 59.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/aphasia.html"},

Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias. When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia . When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia . When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat . It may feel like your heart skipped a beat. There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. What causes an arrhythmia? Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack , smoking , congenital heart defects , and stress. Other factors that could increase your risk for some types of arrhythmias could include if you: Have a family history of arrhythmias. Have certain health conditions, which can include heart and blood vessel diseases , lung diseases , kidney diseases , obesity , and sleep apnea . Are an older adult. Have had recent surgery for your heart, lungs, or throat. Take certain medicines for other health conditions. Use illegal drugs . If you have risk factors, some situations that make your heart work harder, raise your blood pressure, or cause strong emotional stress may trigger an arrhythmia. What are the symptoms of an arrhythmia? You may not have any noticeable symptoms of an arrhythmia. Your provider may find an arrhythmia during your routine checkup . Symptoms of an arrhythmia can include: Fast or slow heartbeat Skipping, fluttering, or pounding heartbeats Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness or fainting Shortness of breath Sweating Tiredness or weakness Seek emergency medical care if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or think you are having a heart attack. How is an arrhythmia diagnosed? To find out if you have an arrhythmia, your health care provider may order an electrocardiogram (EKG). This test records your heart's electrical activity and is the most common for finding an arrhythmia. Your provider may also: Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and lifestyle habits. Do a physical exam, which includes checking your heartbeat and pulse. Order blood tests and other heart tests . Check your legs or feet for swelling. Look for signs of other health conditions that could cause an arrythmia, such as thyroid disease . What are the treatments for an arrhythmia? Treatment may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker , or sometimes surgery. Your provider may also recommend avoiding activities that may trigger your arrhythmia. The goal of treatment is to restore a normal heart rhythm. If not treated, arrhythmias can damage your heart, brain, and other organs and could be life-threatening. Can arrhythmias be prevented?

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system . Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood. What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? AVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life. What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? The symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located. They can happen anywhere in the body, but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few, if any, major symptoms. But if a weakened blood vessel bursts, it can spill blood into the brain (called a hemorrhage). Severe hemorrhages can cause a stroke and brain damage. If an AVM is causing symptoms, they can include: Seizures Headache Pain in the area where the AVM is located Vision problems Muscle weakness Problems with movement and speech Confusion Dizziness Loss of consciousness How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed? To find out if you have an AVM, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history. Will do a physical exam. This may include listening for a bruit. A bruit is whooshing sound caused by the rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM. May order imaging tests , such as a CT scan , MRI , ultrasound , or cerebral angiography. For a cerebral angiography, you are injected with a special dye that helps the blood vessels in your brain show up on x-rays . What are the treatments for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)?

They may spend a lot of time putting things in order, or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their \"own world.\" At well-child checkups, the health care provider should check your child's development. If there are signs of ASD, your child will have a comprehensive evaluation. It may include a team of specialists, doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis. The causes of ASD are not known. Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles. There is currently no one standard treatment for ASD.

{"chunk_id": "154_1", "topic_id": "154", "topic_title": "Autoimmune Diseases", "content": "What are autoimmune diseases? Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes , the immune system attacks the pancreas. And in rheumatoid arthritis , the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes. What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people. Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it. Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases? Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation. But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms. The symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time. How are autoimmune diseases diagnosed? Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis. To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,: Learn about the health conditions in your family history . What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor. Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor. See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor). What are the treatments for autoimmune diseases? The treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you corticosteroids or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 559, "char_count": 3333, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Autoimmune Diseases"], "search_terms": ["autoimmune diseases"], "quality_score": 65.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html"},

Under a microscope, they look like balls, rods, or spirals. They can be found almost everywhere on Earth. There are lots of bacteria in and on your body. In fact, your body has about 10 times more bacteria cells than human cells. There are many different types of bacteria. Most types don't make you sick. Some types are helpful. For example, \"good\" bacteria in your digestive system can help your body digest food and absorb vitamins and minerals . They can help protect you from getting sick. Bacteria are also used in making foods like yogurt and cheese. But some types of bacteria can cause an infection and make you sick. They are called infectious bacteria. These bacteria can reproduce quickly in your body. Many of them give off toxins (poisons) that can damage your cells and make you sick. Other types can move into and damage your tissues. A few examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus , Staphylococcus , and E. coli . How do bacterial infections spread? There are different ways that bacterial infections may spread: Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes. By touching surfaces or objects that have the bacteria on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Through cuts, scrapes, and skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy . Through contaminated food or water . By being bitten by an infected insect or animal . Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection. What are the treatments for bacterial infections? Sometimes your immune system may be able to fight off a bacterial infection. But when you do need treatment, it will be with antibiotics . When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Each time you take them, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant to the effects of the antibiotics. This is called antibiotic resistance . When this happens, the bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. They can cause resistant infections, which can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. Can bacterial infections be prevented? You can help prevent some bacterial infections by: Getting vaccines that protect against bacterial infections. Having good hygiene habits . These include washing your hands often and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. Paying attention to food safety . Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that your frequently touch. Preventing insect bites by using a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. when you go outdoors.

The viruses that cause bird flu normally only infect birds, including chickens, other poultry, and wild birds such as ducks. But sometimes the viruses can infect other animals and, in rare cases, people. A few types of these viruses have caused most of the infections in people. They are the H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses. These infections in people have mainly been in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. Although it's very rare, there have also been some infections in people in the United States. How do you get bird flu? The most common ways you can get bird flu are from: Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after handling infected live or dead birds Touching surfaces or handling items contaminated by bird flu viruses and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Breathing in droplets or dust contaminated with the virus It's also possible (but very rare) to get bird flu from: Another type of animal who has bird flu. Bird flu can also infect many other animals, including some dogs, cats, certain wild and zoo animals, and livestock such as cattle. These animals can then spread the flu to people. Another person. Eating poultry, eggs, and beef that were not properly handled and cooked. Drinking raw milk. Who is more likely to get bird flu? Certain people may be more likely to get bird flu, including: Poultry workers Animal handlers Wildlife biologists Disease control workers Research laboratory workers Veterinarians People who travel to countries where bird flu is present What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Sometimes bird flu doesn't cause any symptoms. But if you do feel sick, your symptoms can range from mild to severe. Often, the symptoms are similar to the (seasonal) flu , such as: Fever (but not everyone has a fever) Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Fatigue Headaches Eye redness ( conjunctivitis ) Trouble breathing Diarrhea People with severe illness from bird flu may have pneumonia and might need to be hospitalized. How is bird flu diagnosed? Laboratory testing is used to diagnose bird flu. It's usually done with a nasal or throat swab . This testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness. For people who are severely ill, health care providers may do testing of a different sample, such as fluid taken during a bronchoalveolar lavage or other procedure. What are the treatments for bird flu? Bird flu is treated with antiviral medicines. It's important to get them as soon as possible. The medicines may make your illness less severe. You may also be given antiviral medicines if you were exposed to a person or animal who has the virus. This may help prevent you from getting sick. Can bird flu be prevented? There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government has developed a virus that is similar to some H5N1 viruses. The virus could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed. It's important to take precautions to prevent bird flu: If you have a job or pastime that puts you in contact with birds or other animals, make sure to use proper protective equipment. Otherwise try to avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other animals. Since it's possible to get bird flu through some foods, make sure to handle and cook your food safely and avoid raw milk.

{"chunk_id": "1127_1", "topic_id": "1127", "topic_title": "Birth Defects", "content": "What are birth defects? A birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body. Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect. A birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease , are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is. What causes birth defects? For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include: Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome . With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing. Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome . In other cases, such as with Down syndrome , the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines , chemicals, or other toxic substances . For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . Infections during pregnancy . For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain . Lack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects. Who is at risk of having a baby with birth defects? Certain factors may increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as: Smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancy Having certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes , before and during pregnancy Taking certain medicines Having someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor , Being an older mother, typically over the age of 34 years How are birth defects diagnosed? Health care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing . That's why it important to get regular prenatal care . Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening . Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms. What are the treatments for birth defects? Children with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices , physical therapy, and speech therapy. Often, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs. Can birth defects be prevented? Not all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby: Start prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancy Get 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant. Don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugs Talk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking.

It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. What is diabetes? Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range. What are blood glucose targets? If you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are: Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL Your blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team about the best target range for you. When and how should I check my blood glucose? If you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it. The most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose. Your provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C . It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals. What happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high? High blood glucose is called hyperglycemia . Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include: Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision If you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan , physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines . High blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands . What happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me? Hypoglycemia , also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you. Symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include: Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger Low blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible. Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease , kidney disease , and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics , can also cause it.

High blood pressure , also called hypertension, is when blood puts too much pressure against the walls of your arteries. Almost half of American adults have high blood pressure, usually with no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke , heart failure , heart attack , and kidney disease . What lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure? Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure: Losing weight Being physically active Managing stress Reducing sodium in your diet Avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines work? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If these medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest that you take another type of blood pressure medicine. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes. Doing both helps keep blood pressure lower than lifestyle changes or medicines alone.

They do not break up clots that you already have. But they can stop those clots from getting bigger. It's important to treat blood clots, because clots in your blood vessels and heart can cause heart attacks , strokes , and blockages. Who needs blood thinners? You may need a blood thinner if you have: Certain heart or blood vessel diseases An abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation A heart valve replacement A risk of blood clots after surgery Congenital heart defects What are the different types of blood thinners? There are different types of blood thinners: Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin), slow down your body's process of making clots. Antiplatelets, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot. Antiplatelets are mainly taken by people who have had a heart attack or stroke. How can I take blood thinners safely? When you take a blood thinner, follow the directions carefully. Blood thinners may interact with certain foods, medicines, vitamins, and alcohol. Make sure that your health care provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using. You may need regular blood tests to check how well your blood is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding. What are the side effects of blood thinners? Bleeding is the most common side effect of blood thinners. They can also cause an upset stomach, nausea , and diarrhea . Other possible side effects can depend on which type of blood thinner that you are taking. Call your provider if you have any sign of serious bleeding, such as: Menstrual bleeding that is much heavier than normal Red or brown urine Bowel movements that are red or black Bleeding from the gums or nose that does not stop quickly Vomit that is brown or bright red Coughing up something red Severe pain, such as a headache or stomachache Unusual bruising A cut that does not stop bleeding A serious fall or bump on the head Dizziness or weakness", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 369, "char_count": 2175, "synonyms": ["Anti-platelet drugs", "Anticoagulants"], "mesh_terms": ["Heparin", "Warfarin", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Anticoagulants"], "search_terms": ["blood thinners", "anti-platelet drugs", "anticoagulants", "heparin", "warfarin", "platelet aggregation inhibitors"], "quality_score": 82.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html"},

Body lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed. Body lice are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and pubic lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. Body lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever. How do body lice spread? Body lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals. Who is at risk for body lice? Body lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often people experiencing homelessness . In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters. What are the symptoms of body lice? The most common symptom of body lice is intense itching . There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with bacteria or fungi . If someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs). How do you know if you have body lice? A diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits. What are the treatments for body lice? The main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine.

Keeping track of your weight is one way to check for changes in your health, but it can't tell you the whole story. That's because your weight includes muscle, bone, fat, and water. Also, everyday factors can play a role in your weight, such as your: Diet Activity level Stress level Sleep habits Family history and genetics Age What factors help determine a healthy body weight? A healthy weight is more than just a number on the scale. It's about feeling good, having energy, and lowering your risk of disease. Your health care provider can help you determine a healthy body weight based on several factors. These include your: Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It also may overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons or others who have lost muscle. Waist circumference. If most of your body fat is around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, you may be at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes . Health history. Your health care provider will likely consider your risk factors for diseases and health conditions, such as having high cholesterol , in determining your healthy body weight. What are body weight ranges? Having a healthy body weight may lower your chance of developing certain health problems. Carrying too much or too little weight can affect your health. Ranges of body weight include: Underweight. Your weight is lower than it should be for your health. Normal. Your weight is within a healthy range. Overweight. Your weight is greater than it should be for your health. Obese . Your body fat is greater than it should be for your health. Body weight needs can be different at different ages. For children, weight and growth are tracked over time based on their age. For older adults , keeping muscle and strength is key, and sudden weight loss should always be checked by your provider. What if I have a sudden gain or loss of weight? Talk to your provider if you're losing or gaining weight without trying. A sudden, unexpected change in weight can be a sign of a medical problem. Causes for sudden weight loss can include: Thyroid problems Cancer Infectious diseases Digestive diseases Certain medicines Causes for sudden weight gain can include: Certain medicines Thyroid problems Heart failure Kidney disease Liver disease How can I maintain a healthy body weight? Maintaining a healthy body weight can improve energy, sleep, and overall wellbeing. Talk to your provider about what a healthy weight would be for you. If they recommend that you gain or lose weight , they might refer you to a dietician for support. A dietician is a professional who has special training to help you learn the best way to eat. Good nutrition and exercise can help in losing weight . Even a small change in weight can lower your risk of developing certain diseases. Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet and treating any underlying medical problems can help you gain weight . Focus on your health, not just the number on the scale.

Common breast changes and conditions can include: Fibrocystic breast changes can include lumpiness, thickening, and swelling, often just before your period . Your breasts may feel painful, swollen, or tender. Cysts are fluid-filled lumps that may be tender. Fibroadenomas are solid, round, rubbery lumps that easily move when pushed, occurring most in younger women. Intraductal papillomas are wart-like benign tumors that grow in the milk duct of the breast. Blocked milk ducts. Milk production when you're not breastfeeding.

C. diff is a bacterium that can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis. You may see it called other names, such as Clostridioides difficile (the new name), Clostridium difficile (an older name), and C. diff icile. It causes close to half a million illnesses each year. What causes C. diff infections? C. diff bacteria are commonly found in the environment, but people usually only get C. diff infections when they are taking antibiotics . That's because antibiotics not only wipe out bad germs, but they also kill the good germs that protect your body against infections. The effect of antibiotics can last as long as several months. If you come in contact with C. diff germs during this time, you can get sick. You are more likely to get a C. diff infection if you take antibiotics for more than a week. C. diff spreads when people touch food, surfaces, or objects that are contaminated with feces (poop) from a person who has C. diff . Who is more likely to get a C. diff infection? You are at more likely to get a C. diff infection if you: Are taking antibiotics Are 65 or older Recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home Have a weakened immune system Have had a previous infection with C. diff or were exposed to it What are the symptoms of C. diff infections? The symptoms of C. diff infections include: Diarrhea (loose, watery stools) or frequent bowel movements for several days Fever Stomach tenderness or pain Loss of appetite Nausea Severe diarrhea causes you to lose a lot of fluids. This can put you at risk for dehydration . How are C. diff infections diagnosed? If you have been taking antibiotics recently and have symptoms of a C. diff infection, you should see your health care provider. Your provider will ask about your symptoms and do a lab test of your stool . In some cases, you might also need an imaging test such as an x-ray or CT scan to check for complications. What are the treatments for C. diff infections? Certain antibiotics can treat C. diff infections. If you were already taking a different antibiotic when you got C. diff , your provider may ask you to stop taking that one. If you have a severe case, you may need to stay in the hospital. If you have very severe pain or serious complications, you may need surgery to remove the diseased part of your colon. About 1 in 6 people who have had a C. diff infection will get it again within the following 2 to 8 weeks. This is called recurrent C. diff . It could be that your original infection came back or that you have a new infection. Contact your provider if your symptoms come back. For people who keep getting C. diff infections, treatments such as fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have shown promising results. FMT uses stool (or bacteria from stool) from a healthy donor to try to restore the balance of healthy bacteria in your intestines. Can C. diff infections be prevented? There are steps you can take to try to prevent getting or spreading C. diff : Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom and before you eat. If you have diarrhea, clean the bathroom that you used before anyone else uses it. Use bleach mixed with water or another disinfectant to clean the toilet seat, handle, and lid.

Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants including: Coffee beans Tea leaves Kola nuts, which are used to flavor soft drink colas Cacao pods, which are used to make chocolate products There is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine, which is added to some medicines, foods, and drinks. For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and \"energy-boosting\" gums and snacks. Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally: An 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mg A 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mg An 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mg An 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mg What are caffeine's effects on the body? Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. It: Stimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energy Is a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more Increases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburn May interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body Increases your blood pressure Within one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours. What are the side effects from too much caffeine? For most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as: Restlessness and shakiness Insomnia Headaches Dizziness Fast heart rate Dehydration Anxiety Dependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same results Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. What are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem? Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes. Sometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions. Who should avoid or limit caffeine? You should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you: Are pregnant , since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby. Are breastfeeding , since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby. Have sleep disorders , including insomnia. Have migraines or other chronic headaches. Have anxiety. Have GERD or ulcers . Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat). Have high blood pressure . Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics , asthma medicines, and heart medicines.

Calcium is a mineral , a nutrient that you need (in small amounts) to keep your body healthy. You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral. Calcium has many important jobs: To build and maintain strong bones. Your body stores almost all of its calcium in your bones and teeth to keep them strong. To help your muscles move. To help your nerves to carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. To help your blood vessels move blood throughout your body. To help release hormones that affect many functions in your body. Not getting enough calcium can cause several conditions, including: Osteoporosis , a disease which can make your bones weaker and more likely to break. Rickets , a disease in children that causes soft, weak bones. Osteomalacia, a condition which causes soft bones in children and adults. How do I get calcium? You can get calcium from foods and supplements. You may be able to get enough calcium by eating a variety of foods, including: Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. These are the main food sources of calcium for most people in the United States. Leafy, green vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Fish with soft bones that you can eat, such as canned sardines and salmon. Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. The product labels for these foods will show how much calcium they have. Calcium is available in supplements. It is also included in many multivitamins. The two main forms of calcium supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate: Calcium carbonate is absorbed best when taken with food. Some over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums and Rolaids, also contain calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is absorbed well on an empty stomach or a full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid absorb calcium citrate more easily than calcium carbonate. Calcium is absorbed best when you take 500 mg or less at one time. If you are taking more than that amount each day, take a smaller dose twice a day rather than taking it all at once. Calcium supplements might cause gas , bloating, and constipation in some people. If you have any of these symptoms, you could try: Spreading out the calcium dose throughout the day Taking it with meals Switching the form of calcium you take How much calcium do I need? The amount of calcium you need each day depends on your age and other factors.

{"chunk_id": "25_1", "topic_id": "25", "topic_title": "Cancer", "content": "What is cancer? Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. What are the types of cancer? There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Cancer can start almost anywhere in your body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. Cancer may also be described by the type of cell that formed it, such as sarcoma if cancer begins in your bone and soft tissue. Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. It is formed by epithelial cells, the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of your body. How does cancer develop? Cancer is a genetic disease. That means changes in your genes cause it. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents. Genetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun Smoking Your diet Physical inactivity What are the symptoms of cancer? Cancer symptoms depend on the type of cancer. For example, some of the symptoms that cancer may cause can include: A lump in your breast Blood in your urine (pee) or stool (poop) Bleeding or bruising for no known reason A sore that doesn't heal Trouble swallowing A new mole or a change to a mole you already have Cancer may cause various symptoms but often doesn't cause pain. Don't wait until you're having pain before seeing your health care provider. See your provider if you have symptoms that don't get better in a few weeks. How is cancer diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose cancer. The tests ordered are usually based on your symptoms. Your provider may: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had cancer Do a physical exam Do a screening test such as a mammogram , colonoscopy , or a Pap test Order blood tests or imaging tests To find out if you have cancer, your provider may order a biopsy . A biopsy is the procedure of removing and examining tissue, cells, or fluids from your body. What are the treatments for cancer? Treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation , and/or chemotherapy . Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biological therapy, or stem cell transplantation . Can cancer be prevented? It's usually not possible to know exactly why cancer develops in some people but not others. There are some things that you can't control which may increase or decrease your risk of getting cancer, such as inheriting certain genes or your age. But some lifestyle habits may increase your risk of certain types of cancer. Avoid or reduce lifestyle habits such as: Smoking and tobacco use Having too much sun exposure Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough physical activity Having obesity NIH: National Cancer Institute", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 683, "char_count": 3916, "synonyms": ["Carcinoma", "Malignancy", "Neoplasms", "Tumor"], "mesh_terms": ["Neoplasms"], "search_terms": ["tumor", "carcinoma", "neoplasms", "malignancy", "cancer"], "quality_score": 85.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html"},

You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might consider is using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and therapies that are not part of standard medical care. CAM for cancer treatment involves caring for your mind, body, and spirit. Some methods focus on your breathing or body movements to help you relax. Other CAM therapies may use special foods, supplements , or diets. Examples of CAM therapies include acupuncture , chiropractic , and herbal medicines . CAM claims can sound promising, but often, researchers don't know how safe some are or how well they work. Studies are ongoing to find out the safety and usefulness of many of these methods. How are complementary and alternative therapies used for cancer care? If you're thinking about using CAM along with your standard care, it's called integrative medicine. Some methods, such as acupuncture, might help with nausea , pain, and other side effects of cancer treatment. A few reasons that people with cancer may use CAM include to: Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments Ease worries about cancer treatment and related stress Feel that they are doing something more to help their care CAM treatments don't work for everyone. Some products might interact with your other medicines. Talk to your health care provider about all the different types of treatment you use.

{"chunk_id": "464_1", "topic_id": "464", "topic_title": "Cancer Chemotherapy", "content": "What is cancer chemotherapy? Cancer chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment. It uses medicines to destroy cancer cells. Normally, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Cancer cells keep growing without control. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Chemotherapy works by killing the cancer cells, stopping them from spreading, or slowing their growth. Chemotherapy is used to: Treat cancer by curing the cancer, lessening the chance it will return, or stopping or slowing its growth. Ease cancer symptoms by shrinking tumors that are causing pain and other problems. What are the side effects of chemotherapy? Chemotherapy does not just destroy cancer cells. It can also harm some healthy cells, which causes side effects. You may have a lot of side effects, some side effects, or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts. Some common side effects are: Mouth sores Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Pain Hair loss There are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them. Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over, so most side effects go away over time. What can I expect when getting chemotherapy? You may get chemotherapy in a hospital, at home, at your provider's office, or a medical clinic. You might be given the medicines by mouth, in a shot, as a cream, through a catheter (a thin tube), or intravenously (by IV). Your treatment plan will depend on the type of cancer you have, which chemotherapy medicines are used, the treatment goals, and how your body responds to the medicines. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day, every week, or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells.

It is a type of biological therapy. Biological therapy uses substances made from living organisms or versions of these substances made in a lab. Immunotherapy isn't used for all cancers, and the response to treatment varies. If you're getting immunotherapy, your health care provider will monitor your treatment closely. When is immunotherapy used for cancer treatment? Immunotherapy isn't used as often as other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . But immunotherapy is used for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types. How does immunotherapy work against cancer? Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. When you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping, and old cells don't die when they should. They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they can hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can \"mark\" your cancer cells. This makes it easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of targeted therapy that uses medicines or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Other types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better against cancer. How is immunotherapy given? There are different forms of immunotherapy, so how they are given varies. You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into your bladder. How often and how long you get immunotherapy also varies. It depends on your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles, so your body has time to rest and recover. What are the side effects of immunotherapy? You may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at the needle site if you get it by IV. Other side effects may include flu-like symptoms or, rarely, severe reactions.

Many Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. Even though cancer may be life-threatening, many people have successful treatment. Others live with cancer for a very long time. For most people with cancer, learning to live with the disease is one of the biggest challenges they've ever faced. That's because having cancer touches just about every part of your life and the lives of those around you. Cancer and its treatment may change: Your daily routines and ability to work Your important relationships The way you look, feel, and think about yourself If you learn what to expect, you may feel more in control and prepared to cope with these changes. Your health care provider can help you find information and support services that are right for you. Coping with feelings about having cancer Having cancer may cause a range of strong emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, worry, or guilt. These feelings are normal, and they're likely to change over time. It's helpful to sort out your feelings in a way that's comfortable for you. You might try: Talking openly with someone you trust Writing about your feelings Using relaxation methods, such as meditation and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) Doing the things you enjoy, giving yourself a break from focusing on cancer If your emotions seem to take over your life, tell your provider. You may need extra support if you have symptoms of depression , stress , anxiety , or panic disorder . Communicating with your health care team During cancer treatment, you usually have a team of providers. Along with doctors and nurses, you may be able to talk with social workers, pharmacists, dietitians, and other health professionals. These professionals are prepared to help you deal with the issues that cancer brings up, including concerns about finances . But it's up to you to let your team know what's on your mind. Good communication with your providers may help you feel more in control and satisfied with your care. Your communications may be better if you: Tell your providers how much you want to know about your cancer and its treatment. Do you want all the details or just the big picture? Write down your questions and concerns before your visits. Bring a family member or a friend to your visits. This person can help by listening, taking notes, and asking questions. Talking openly with family and friends Cancer changes the daily routines and roles of the people who love and support you. They may need to start doing the things you've always done for them. And you may need their help doing things you've always done for yourself. These changes can be difficult for everyone. It may help to have an honest talk about changing roles and needs. If that sounds too hard, ask a social worker or another member of your care team to help you talk with family and friends who are helping with your care. These caregivers may need some support , too. Dealing with changes in your self-image Cancer and its treatment may cause some big changes in how you look, feel, and think about yourself. For example, you may have: Less energy Temporary or permanent changes in your body, such as scars , or hair loss from chemotherapy Problems being sexually close or doubts about dating Coping with these changes can be hard. But most people find ways to feel more positive over time. If you feel well enough, you might try: Exercise . Walking, yoga, or other types of movement may help you feel stronger and more in control of your body. But check with your provider first. Staying involved in life and helping others. Think about volunteering, hobbies, or other activities that might make you feel good about yourself. Counseling for sexual problems. Talking with a professional, either with a partner or on your own, may help. Adjusting to life after treatment After treatment, you'll have regular cancer follow-up care. Your provider will explain the schedule of checkups and tests you'll need. This is a good time to discuss the challenges you may face ahead.

{"chunk_id": "3670_1", "topic_id": "3670", "topic_title": "Carbohydrates", "content": "What are carbohydrates? Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats , carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar , is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use. What are the different types of carbohydrates? There are three main types of carbohydrates: Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk. Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn. Fiber . It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation . They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains. Which foods have carbohydrates? Common foods with carbohydrates include: Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils. Which types of carbohydrates should I eat? You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health: When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains: Whole grains are foods like whole-wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like vitamins , minerals , and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed. Refined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health. Eat foods with lots of fiber. The Nutrition Facts labels on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has. Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink. How many carbohydrates should I eat? There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health. Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet? Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day.

{"chunk_id": "897_1", "topic_id": "897", "topic_title": "Celiac Disease", "content": "What is celiac disease? Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems Celiac disease is triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements , hair and skin products, toothpastes, and lip balm. Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity . Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue . But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does. Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy , is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing . And a wheat allergy will not cause long-term damage to the small intestine. What causes celiac disease? The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease. Who is more likely to develop celiac disease? Celiac disease is more common if you: Have a family member who has the disease Have Down syndrome , Turner syndrome , or Williams syndrome Are White Are female What are the symptoms of celiac disease? The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms. Some of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include: Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly) Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop) Constipation Gas Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine Nausea and vomiting Pain in the abdomen (belly) Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children Some people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as: Fatigue Depression and anxiety Irritability (in children) Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults) Bone or joint pain Symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouth What other problems can celiac disease cause? Over time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include: Malnutrition Anemia , especially iron-deficiency anemia Bone loss Nervous system problems such as headaches , balance problems , or peripheral neuropathy Reproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and women How is celiac disease diagnosed? If you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam. If your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy. What are the treatments for celiac disease? The treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list.

{"chunk_id": "6206_1", "topic_id": "6206", "topic_title": "Cervical Cancer Screening", "content": "What is cervical cancer screening? Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). Cervical cancer screening is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. Cervical cancer screening tests look for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. Before cervical cells become cancer, they start to look abnormal. These cells are called \"precancers\". If they aren't destroyed or removed, they may become cancer cells that grow out of control and spread to other parts of your body. Screening can help find abnormal cells so you can get treatment to prevent cervical cancer. These tests can also help to find cervical cancer early when it's usually easier to treat. What tests screen for cervical cancer? Cervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup during a pelvic exam. These tests use a sample of cervical cells that your health care provider collects with a swab: A Pap test (also called a Pap smear or cervical cytology) checks for abnormal cells so they can be treated before they become cancer. An HPV (human papillomavirus) test checks for certain HPV infections that can cause cancer. HPV is a group of viruses that spread through sexual contact. The types that cause cancer are called \"high-risk HPV.\" The HPV/Pap cotest uses an HPV and Pap test together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes. If your screening tests are abnormal, your provider may do more tests, such as a biopsy . How often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get will depend on your age and health history. What are the possible benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening? Cervical cancer screening saves lives. Screening can detect cervical changes early, lowering your chance of dying from cervical cancer. But, cervical cancer screening has potential harms. The possible harms of cervical cancer screening include: The results can sometimes be wrong. Getting a false-positive result means that your test results appear abnormal, but there are no precancerous or cancerous cells. A false-positive may lead to: Worry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer. Follow-up tests or treatment that you may not have needed. Getting a false-negative result means that your test results appear normal, but there are precancer or cancerous cells. A false-negative may lead to: You may delay seeking treatment even if you have symptoms. Should I be screened for cervical cancer? Talk with your provider about how often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get. This will depend on your age and health history. If you have a cervix, it's recommended that you have your first Pap smear at age 21 and begin screening with an HPV test at age 25. You may need screening more often if you: Had an abnormal HPV test, Pap smear, or cervical biopsy in the recent past. Have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Have a weakened immune system . Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between the years 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages . If you are over age 65 and have had regular Pap smear screenings with normal results, your provider may tell you that you no longer need them. If you have HIV , you may need to continue screenings after age 65. You don't need cervical cancer screening if you had a total hysterectomy (surgery to remove your uterus and cervix) because of a condition that was not cancer. But if your hysterectomy was related to cervical cancer or precancer, ask your provider whether you need screening.

The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave your body. You may not have any symptoms of a cervix disorder, but routine pelvic exams and a Pap smear test can help determine if you may need treatment. Cervix disorders can include: Cervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. Cervicitis is swelling of the cervix. An infection usually causes it, but it can also be caused by skin irritation. Treatment can help you avoid potential complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . Cervical incompetence (also called cervical insufficiency) can happen during pregnancy. The opening of your cervix widens too early. This may cause you to give birth too soon , or you could lose the fetus . Cervical polyps and cysts are fleshy or fluid-filled growths on your cervix. These growths are usually benign (not cancer). They are more common during your reproductive years, especially after age 20. Who is more likely to develop cervix disorders? You are more likely to develop a cervix disorder if: You've had a previous cervical procedure or surgery. You've had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea . You used a latex condom or a feminine product such as a spermicide or douche that irritated the skin of your vagina. You left something in your vagina too long, such as a diaphragm, tampon, or cervical cap, and it caused irritation. You don't consistently use a condom when you have sex, or you have multiple sex partners. What are the symptoms of cervix disorders? You may not know that something is wrong since cervix disorders may not have any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may vary based on the cervix disorder. Symptoms can include: Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding between menstrual periods Pain during sex or a pelvic exam Abnormal vaginal discharge If you are pregnant , a few signs of an incompetent cervix could include light vaginal bleeding, a feeling of pelvic pressure, or mild cramps. But you may not have any signs. How are cervix disorders diagnosed? Even if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may notice changes to the cells of your cervix during a pelvic exam. Your provider may look for: Redness or inflammation (swelling) of your cervix or vaginal walls Vaginal discharge or strong odor Your provider may perform a Pap test to look for changes in your cervix. What are the treatments for cervix disorders? The treatment for cervix disorders depends on the cause. It might include antibiotics or stopping using a product that causes skin irritation. If you have had an incompetent cervix in the past, you might take medicine or have ultrasound imaging tests to check how your pregnancy is going. Can cervix disorders be prevented? You can take steps to prevent some cervix disorders. This can include to: Use a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Have regular pelvic exams. Get tested for STIs as needed.

In the United States, almost one in three babies are born this way. Some cesarean deliveries are planned. Others are emergency cesarean deliveries, which are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery. When is a cesarean delivery needed? You may need a cesarean delivery because: You have health problems , including infection You are carrying more than one baby Your baby is too big Your baby is in the wrong position Your baby's health is in danger Labor is not moving along as it should There are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby) Not everyone who has had a cesarean delivery before will need another one next time. You may be able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Talk to your health care provider about what is right for you. How is a cesarean delivery done? Before the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get: An epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine. A spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid. General anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency cesarean deliveries. During the surgery, the surgeon will: Make a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical. Open the amniotic sac and take out your baby. Cut the umbilical cord and the placenta. Close the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve. What are the risks of a cesarean delivery? A cesarean delivery is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include: Infection Blood loss Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder A reaction to the medicines or anesthesia used Some of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a cesarean delivery than from a vaginal birth. And having a cesarean delivery can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies.

It is usually spread by infected blood-sucking bugs called triatomine bugs. They are also known as \"kissing bugs\" because they often bite people's faces. When one of these bugs bites you, it leaves behind infected waste. You can become infected if you rub the waste in your eyes or nose, the bite wound, or a cut. Chagas disease can also spread through contaminated food, a blood transfusion, a donated organ, or from the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. Who is more likely to develop Chagas disease?

It includes labor and delivery of the fetus and the placenta. The placenta is the organ that supplies food and oxygen through the umbilical cord to your fetus during pregnancy . A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks. Labor usually begins between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy . It is how your body prepares to give birth to your baby. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks. How do I know if I'm going into labor? Signs that you might be going into labor include: Regular contractions start to come closer together Leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina Low, dull backache Abdominal (belly) cramps The signs of labor, when labor starts, and the time it takes to deliver your baby can vary with each pregnancy. Call your health care provider if you have any signs of labor, even if it is before your due date. What are the stages of labor? Labor happens in three stages. The first stage begins with contractions. This stage could last for hours or days. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide to allow your baby to pass through. The second stage is when you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward, your baby is born. The third stage is when you deliver the placenta, and your provider cuts the umbilical cord. Sometimes, mothers need to have labor induced. Medicines or other methods are used to start labor. This is usually only done when the due date has passed or if a problem with the pregnancy risks the health of the mother or the fetus. Mothers and their babies are closely monitored during labor and delivery. Delivery can occur either vaginally through the birth canal, or if there are complications , the delivery may be done surgically by a Cesarean section . This is when the baby is taken out through your abdomen (belly) and uterus. What are the options for pain relief during childbirth? The amount of pain during childbirth can vary based on the size and position of the baby, your level of comfort with the process, and the strength of your contractions. Options for pain relief during labor and delivery may include: Medicines may reduce the pain, but they don't stop it completely. Natural methods ease pain without taking medicines. A few examples include using relaxation techniques, a birthing ball, massage, or taking a bath or shower. Combination of medicines and natural methods.

{"chunk_id": "1438_1", "topic_id": "1438", "topic_title": "Childhood Leukemia", "content": "What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What are the types of leukemia in children? There are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing). They usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Most childhood leukemias are acute: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) , which is the most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children . In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , which happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. Other types of leukemia are chronic (slow growing). They usually get worse over a longer period of time. They are rare in children: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children. There are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). What causes leukemia in children? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia. Who is at risk for leukemia in children? The factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia include: Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia Past treatment with chemotherapy Exposure to radiation , including radiation therapy Having certain genetic conditions , such as Ataxia telangiectasia Down syndrome Fanconi anemia Li-Fraumeni syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 There are other factors that may raise the risk of getting one or more of the specific types of childhood leukemia. What are the symptoms of leukemia in children? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first. How is leukemia in children diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes Once there is a diagnosis of leukemia, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What are the treatments for leukemia in children? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type it is, how severe the leukemia is, the child's age, and other factors. Possible treatments might include: chemotherapy radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Treatment for childhood leukemia is often successful. But the treatments can cause complications right away or later in life. Children who survived leukemia will need follow-up care the rest of their lives to watch for and treat any complications they may have.

{"chunk_id": "1342_1", "topic_id": "1342", "topic_title": "Childhood Vaccines", "content": "What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria . Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make your child sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps the body fight off the germs. Your child's immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. Why do I need to vaccinate my child? Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but there are some serious diseases they can't handle. That's why they need vaccines to strengthen their immune system. These diseases once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. But now with vaccines, your child can get immunity from these diseases without having to get sick. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. Vaccinating your child also protects others. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. The entire community is less likely to get the disease. This is called \"community immunity.\" Community immunity is especially important for the people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe for children? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and autism. Can vaccines overload my child's immune system? No, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child's immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they are getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, they are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter every day in their environment. When do I need to vaccinate my child? Your child will get vaccines during well-child visits . They will be given according to the vaccine schedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. Following the vaccine schedule allows your child to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.

But if it's not treated, chlamydia can cause serious health problems. How is chlamydia spread? You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has chlamydia. Chlamydia can also be passed to the baby during childbirth . If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it. Who is more likely to get chlamydia? Chlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get infected with chlamydia if you don't consistently use a condom or if you have multiple partners. What are the symptoms of chlamydia? Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. But even if you don't have symptoms, you can still pass the infection to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with someone who has chlamydia. Symptoms in women include: Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell A burning sensation when urinating If the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal (belly) pain , pain during sex, nausea , and fever . Symptoms in men include: Discharge from your penis A burning sensation when urinating (peeing) Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common) If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding. How is chlamydia diagnosed? There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. Or your provider may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia. Who should be tested for chlamydia? You should go to your provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia or if you have a partner who has an STI. If you are pregnant, you should get a test when you go to your first prenatal visit . People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year: Sexually active women 25 and younger Older women who have new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STI Men who have sex with men (MSM) What other problems can chlamydia cause? In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain , infertility , and ectopic pregnancy . Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications. Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility . Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early . Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV . What are the treatments for chlamydia? Antibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. It is important to take all the medicine that your provider prescribed for you. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused. To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine. It is common to get a repeat infection, so you need to get tested again about three months after treatment. Can chlamydia be prevented? The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms.

The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food that has been contaminated by feces (poop). Cholera is rare in the US. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person. Cholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea. In some cases, the infection can be severe, causing lots of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids, you are at risk for dehydration and shock . Without treatment, you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera, you should get medical care right away. Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics . Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover. There are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it, because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak. There are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection: Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, washing dishes, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Wash your hands often with soap and clean water Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 333, "char_count": 1909, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Cholera"], "search_terms": ["cholera"], "quality_score": 55.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/cholera.html"},

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What are the treatments for high cholesterol? If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you lower your cholesterol levels . But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. But you should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines. Who needs cholesterol medicines? Your health care provider may prescribe cholesterol medicines for you if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke , or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher What are the different types of cholesterol medicines? There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including: Statins . They reduce the amount of cholesterol made in the liver. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants. They keep bile acids, which digest fats and oils, from being absorbed into the body. But your body needs bile acids, so your liver will make more of them. It makes them by breaking down LDL cholesterol, so this helps lower your LDL cholesterol. Your provider may prescribe these medicines if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors. They block how cholesterol is absorbed into the body. They are also used if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Nicotinic acid (niacin). It is a type of B vitamin . It reduces the amount of fats made by your liver, so it lowers your LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Niacin also raises HDL cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects . PCSK9 inhibitors. These are medicines that you inject under your skin. They block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Your provider may prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin if you are at high risk of complications like heart attack or stroke, or if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Fibrates. They lower triglycerides in several complex ways, including reducing the amount of triglycerides made by the liver. They may also help increase HDL cholesterol and may lower LDL levels a bit. If you take them with statins, it might increase the risk of side effects. Combination medicines. They include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine. There are also combination medicines that can treat both high blood pressure and cholesterol. There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have FH. How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take? When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your provider will consider: Your cholesterol levels. Your risk for heart disease and stroke. Your age. Any other health problems you have. Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time.

{"chunk_id": "87_1", "topic_id": "87", "topic_title": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "content": "What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CLL, the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia , and easy bleeding . The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body. CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. It is rare in children . What causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? CLL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown, so it's hard to predict who might get CLL. There are a few factors that might raise your risk. Who is at risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? It is hard to predict who will get CLL. There are a few factors that could raise your risk: Age - your risk goes up as you get older. Most people who are diagnosed with CLL are over 50. Family history of CLL and other blood and bone marrow diseases Racial/ethnic group - CLL is more common in whites than in people from other racial or ethnic groups Exposure to certain chemicals, including Agent Orange, a chemical that was used in the Vietnam War What are the symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? In the beginning, CLL does not cause any symptoms. Later, you can have symptoms such as: Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Weakness or feeling tired Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs Fever and infection Easy bruising or bleeding Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Weight loss for no known reason Drenching night sweats How is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CLL: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) , a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , kidney function tests , liver function tests , and an electrolyte panel . Flow cytometry tests, which check for leukemia cells and identify which type of leukemia it is. The tests can be done on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes If you are diagnosed with CLL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and bone marrow tests . What are the treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? Treatments for CLL include: Watchful waiting, which means that you don't get treatment right away. Your health care provider regularly checks to see if your signs or symptoms appear or change. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy Chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant The goals of treatment are to slow the growth of the leukemia cells and to give you long periods of remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared. The CLL may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.

It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body or all over. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain might be acute or chronic. The type of pain is based on how long and how often you have pain. Acute pain starts suddenly and goes away when the cause is treated or healed. This pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain lasts longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed. If you have chronic pain, it can occur most days or every day and may last for weeks, months, or even years. It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Treatment may not get rid of chronic pain, but it can help with your symptoms. What causes chronic pain? Sometimes, acute pain can become chronic pain. The original cause may have been an injury or infection, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer . In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as mood and stress can make chronic pain worse. What are the symptoms of chronic pain? Since people feel pain in different ways, two people could have the same issue, but each may have different symptoms. Chronic pain can occur anywhere in your body and may cause other symptoms such as fatigue , mood changes, or difficulty sleeping . If you have depression or stress, it may make chronic pain worse. Who is more likely to get chronic pain? Many older adults have chronic pain. Women also report having more chronic pain than men, and they are at a greater risk for many pain conditions. Some people have two or more chronic pain conditions. You may be more likely to have chronic pain if you have certain medical conditions such as: Headaches or migraines Cancer Fibromyalgia Arthritis Nerve damage Back problems How is chronic pain diagnosed?

Some of them are helpful, but others are harmful and cause disease. They can be found everywhere - in our air, soil, and water. They are on our skin and in our bodies. Germs are also on the surfaces and objects that we touch. Sometimes those germs can spread to you and make you sick. For example, there could be germs on a tv remote. You could get infected with the germs if you touch the remote and then rub your eyes or nose or eat with your hands. How can I avoid getting germs from surfaces and objects? To avoid becoming infected by germs from surfaces and objects, it is important to wash your hands often . But you can't wash your hands every time you touch something. So it's also important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects. What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting? Some people think that disinfecting is same thing as cleaning or sanitizing. But they are actually different: Cleaning removes dirt, dust, crumbs, and germs from surfaces or objects. When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you. Disinfecting uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. Sanitizing could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc. For example, there are sanitizing procedures for restaurants and other facilities that prepare food. What you do to sanitize will vary, depending on your needs. You might be mopping a floor using a mop, a chemical, and water. You might use a dishwasher to sanitize the dishes. Or you could be using an antibacterial wipe on a tv remote. If you both clean and disinfect a surface or object, you can further lower the risk of spreading infection. There are products that clean and disinfect at the same time. Which surfaces and objects do I need to clean and disinfect? To prevent the spread of infection, you should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. For example, in your house, this would include countertops, doorknobs, faucet and toilet handles, light switches, remotes, and toys. How can I safely clean and disinfect? It's important to be safe when using cleaning and disinfecting products: Store them in the containers they came in. Always follow the instructions and pay attention to the warnings on the label. Do not mix cleaners and disinfectants unless the labels say that it is safe to do so. Combining certain products (such as chlorine bleach and ammonia cleaners) can cause serious injury or even death.

It is mostly available as an illegal drug that some people use to get high. In rare cases, it is also used as a prescription drug for for anesthesia during certain surgeries. As a street (illegal) drug, cocaine is usually a fine, white, crystal powder. Street dealers sometimes mix it with cornstarch, talcum powder, or flour to make it look like they have more cocaine. That way they can make more money. They may also mix it with other illegal drugs. Another form of the drug is crack cocaine. Crack cocaine has been heated to make it into a rock crystal. How do people use cocaine? People snort cocaine powder through the nose or rub it into their gums. Others dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Some people inject a combination of cocaine and heroin , called a \"speedball.\" Crack cocaine is smoked. What are the short-term effects of cocaine? Cocaine is a stimulant that can make people feel like they have more energy and are extra alert. But it can also make people feel restless, irritable, anxious, and paranoid. Large amounts of cocaine can lead to bizarre, unpredictable, and violent behavior. Cocaine's effects appear almost immediately and disappear within a few minutes to an hour. How long the effects last and how intense they are will depend on how the person used it. In some cases, cocaine can cause very serious health problems such as a heart attack , stroke , or coma . What are the long-term effects of cocaine? People who use cocaine over the long term may develop health problems. Which problems they have will depend on how they used the cocaine: Snorting it can lead to a loss of sense of smell , nosebleeds, nasal damage, and trouble swallowing . Smoking it can cause a cough , asthma , trouble breathing , and a higher risk of infections like pneumonia . Injecting it with a needle can lead to skin or soft tissue infections, as well as scarring . It can cause collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Injecting cocaine also puts a person at higher risk of getting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C . Other long-term effects of cocaine use may include malnutrition and movement disorders , including Parkinson's disease . Repeated use of cocaine can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on cocaine. If someone who is dependent on cocaine stops using it, they will have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include: Depression Restlessness Fatigue Increased appetite Bad dreams and insomnia Slowed thinking Repeated use of cocaine can also lead to cocaine use disorder, also called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use cocaine even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using cocaine becomes their main purpose in life. Can a person overdose on cocaine? It's possible to overdose on cocaine. This happens when a person uses so much cocaine that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. Some people use cocaine along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose. A cocaine overdose can cause health problems such as: Stroke Seizures irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Heart attack There is no specific medicine to treat an overdose. Health care providers will focus on treating the specific health problems caused by the overdose. What are the treatments for cocaine use disorder?

Coronary artery bypass surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to your heart. This surgery is sometimes called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. You may need this surgery if you have a blocked or partially blocked artery in your heart. This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). Your coronary arteries supply blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. This can cause them to harden and narrow. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Before recommending surgery, your health care provider may try other treatments. These could include lifestyle changes , medicines, or angioplasty , a procedure to open your arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery. Who might benefit from coronary artery bypass surgery? Your provider may recommend surgery if you have obstructive coronary artery disease to help lower your risk of a heart attack . They will consider your overall health before deciding if surgery is your best option. You may benefit from surgery if you have: Coronary heart disease with angina (chest pain) Diabetes Multiple blocked coronary arteries Serious heart failure You might need emergency coronary artery bypass surgery to treat a severe heart attack. What happens during coronary artery bypass surgery? During surgery, the surgeon takes healthy blood vessels from another part of your body. These blood vessels are attached to blood vessels above and below the blocked artery to let blood bypass (get around) the blockage. You might need more than one bypass if you have a few blocked arteries. Methods to perform coronary artery bypass surgery include: Traditional CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine pumps blood through your body during the surgery. This is the most common type of CABG surgery. Off-pump CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Minimally invasive CABG methods. Small cuts are made in the chest. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Robotic-assisted surgery. This is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. A machine for pumping blood may be used. Are there any risks from coronary artery bypass surgery? Like all surgery, CABG has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks can include: Arrhythmia Bleeding Heart attack Infection Kidney failure Stroke After coronary artery bypass surgery, many people remain symptom-free for years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins. Or if blockages happen in arteries that weren't blocked before.

Crypto can also be found on surfaces or dirty hands that have been contaminated with the stool (poop) of humans or animals that have the infection. How is cryptosporidiosis spread? You can become infected with Crypto by swallowing the parasite if it is in your food, drinking water, or water that you swim in. You can also get infected when you touch something that has been contaminated, and then you touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. Another way that Crypto can spread is through sexual contact. Who is more likely to get cryptosporidiosis? Certain people are more likely to get Crypto; they include: Children and workers at childcare centers Older adults (ages 75 years and older) People who take care of other people with Crypto International travelers Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unfiltered, untreated water People, including swimmers, who swallow water from contaminated sources People who touch infected animals, often cows or sheep What are the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis? The most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include: Dehydration Weight loss Stomach cramps or pain Fever Nausea and vomiting The symptoms generally begin 2 to 10 days after becoming infected with the parasite. In people with healthy immune systems , the symptoms can last about 1 to 2 weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last longer or come and go for up to 30 days. People with weakened immune systems may develop a serious, chronic illness. Some reasons why you might have a weakened immune system could include: Having HIV Having cancer Having a genetic condition that affects the immune system Taking certain medicines, such as chemotherapy and medicines needed after an organ transplant Some people may not have any symptoms at all. Contact your health care provider if you have watery diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, especially if you have a weakened immune system. How is cryptosporidiosis diagnosed? Cryptosporidiosis is diagnosed by examining stool samples, usually under a microscope. People with Crypto can have many parasites in their stool one day but not as many the next day. So you may need to give the lab three stool samples collected on three different days. This helps make sure that your diagnosis is correct. What are the treatments for cryptosporidiosis? Most people with cryptosporidiosis get better without treatment. It usually takes about one to two weeks. It's important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration if you are pregnant. Infants and young children should also get extra fluids. They should get extra fluids. If you are pregnant or if you think that you or your child are severely dehydrated, contact your provider about how to get enough fluids. Some people who are dehydrated may need to get intravenous (IV) fluids in a hospital. Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicine might help slow down diarrhea, but do not take it without first asking your provider. There is a medicine to treat diarrhea caused by Crypto in people with healthy immune systems. You and your provider can talk about whether that medicine is right for you. Can cryptosporidiosis be prevented? To lower your chance of getting or spreading Crypto: Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the toilet, changing diapers, or touching animals. You also need to wash your hands before eating or preparing food. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against Crypto. Only drink water that you know is safe. Only drink milk and apple cider that have been pasteurized. Don't eat uncooked foods when traveling in countries where the food supply might be unsafe. Never go swimming when you have diarrhea.

There are three types of delirium: Hypoactive, when you are not active and seem sleepy, tired, or depressed Hyperactive, when you are restless or agitated Mixed, when you change back and forth between being hypoactive and hyperactive What causes delirium? There are many different problems that can cause delirium. Some of the more common causes include: Advanced cancer . Alcohol or drugs , either from intoxication or withdrawal. This includes a serious type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome called delirium tremens. It usually happens to people who stop drinking after years of alcohol use disorder (AUD) . Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances . Dementia . Hospitalization , especially in intensive care. Infections , such as urinary tract infections , pneumonia , and the flu . Medicines. This could be a side effect of a medicine, such as sedatives or opioids . Or it could be from withdrawal after stopping a medicine. Metabolic disorders . Organ failure , such as kidney or liver failure. Poisoning . Serious illnesses . Severe pain . Sleep deprivation . Surgeries , including reactions to anesthesia . Who is more likely to get delirium? Certain factors put you at risk for delirium, including: Being in a hospital or nursing home Having dementia Having a serious illness or more than one illness Having an infection Older age Having surgery Taking medicines that affect the mind or behavior Taking high doses of pain medicines , such as opioids What are the symptoms of delirium? The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days. They often come and go. The most common symptoms include: Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night) Changing levels of consciousness Confusion Disorganized thinking, talking in a way that doesn't make sense Disrupted sleep patterns, sleepiness Emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression , irritability, overexcitement Hallucinations and delusions Memory problems, especially with short-term memory Trouble concentrating How is delirium diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Physical and neurological exams Mental status testing, which checks for problems with your thinking and alertness Lab and diagnostic imaging tests Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. You can also have both at the same time. The differences between them are that: Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. It is mainly a problem with attention and staying alert. The symptoms may get better or worse and can last for hours or weeks. Dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. It usually starts with memory loss. The symptoms don't change often, like they can with delirium. Dementia almost never gets better. What are the treatments for delirium? Treatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as: Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain If needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication Can delirium be prevented? Treating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it.

Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors: Being overweight or having obesity Not being physically active Genetics and family history Type 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise. Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes? You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you: Are over age 45. Children, teenagers , and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people. Have prediabetes , which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes Had diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. Have a family history of diabetes Are overweight or have obesity Are Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander Are not physically active Have other conditions such as high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke , polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depression Have low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides Have acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits What are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes? Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include: Increased thirst and urination Increased hunger Feeling tired Blurred vision Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands Sores that do not heal Unexplained weight loss How is type 2 diabetes diagnosed? Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include: A1C test , which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test. Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test. What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes? Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine: A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity . You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any. Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes. You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly. Can type 2 diabetes be prevented? You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 749, "char_count": 4308, "synonyms": ["Type 2 Diabetes"], "mesh_terms": ["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"], "search_terms": ["diabetes mellitus, type 2", "diabetes type 2", "type 2 diabetes"], "quality_score": 70.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html"},

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps glucose get into your cells. With type 1 diabetes , your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes , your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels. Prediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. How do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels? The glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates , or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be. Some, but not all people with diabetes, may need to count the amount of carbs eaten in drinks and meals. Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes , such as vision loss and heart problems . And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on. What's the best diet for diabetes? There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider: Any medicines that you take Your weight Any other health conditions you have Your lifestyle and tastes Your goals All eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times . What foods should I eat if I have diabetes? Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups: Fruits and vegetables Whole grains , such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats Proteins , such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu Nonfat or low-fat dairy , such as milk, yogurt, and cheese What foods should I limit to control my blood glucose? To keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you should have them less often or in smaller amounts. The foods and drinks you should limit include: High-carb foods and drinks , such as: Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks White rice, tortillas, breads, and pasta - especially those made with white flour Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas Fried foods and other foods high in saturated and trans fats . Foods high in sodium (salt). Alcohol . If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man. What else do I need to know about diabetic diets? If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, and help you choose the types of food for each meal or snack. If you take insulin, you may need to learn how to count carbs to help you know how much insulin to take. Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful. Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out. Eating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort.

Over time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness . Some common diabetic eye problems include: Diabetic retinopathy , which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment , where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME) , which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma , a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye. Cataract , which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes. Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems? Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and: Have had diabetes for a long time Don't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure Are pregnant Have high blood cholesterol Smoke tobacco What are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems? In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy. You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms: Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters) Flashes of light A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain Vision loss Eye pain or redness Talk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go: Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision Blurry or wavy vision Vision that changes a lot Trouble seeing colors How are diabetic eye problems diagnosed? Eye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes. What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems? Treatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include: Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye But these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams.

Foot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy , can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet. If you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister , or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet. Having an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene . That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation . This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life. But there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem. How can I protect my feet if I have diabetes? The best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy. Good foot care for people with diabetes includes: Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too. Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes. Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers. Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you. Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw. Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace. Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking. Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet. When should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems? Serious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice: A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet A callus with dried blood inside A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene Remember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 760, "char_count": 4155, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Diabetic Foot"], "search_terms": ["diabetic foot"], "quality_score": 65.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticfoot.html"},

Diabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age. Over time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including: Coronary artery disease (CAD) . It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. Heart failure . With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body. Cardiomyopathy . This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff. Who is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease? Diabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including: High blood pressure High blood levels of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL \"good\" cholesterol Your risk for heart disease is also higher if you Are male Smoke Have obesity Have too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight: For men, that's a waist more than 40 inches For women, that's a waist more than 35 inches Have a family history of heart disease Have chronic kidney disease What are the symptoms of diabetic heart disease? In the early stages, heart disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. But if your heart disease worsens, you can have symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. They might include: Shortness of breath Fatigue Dizziness or fainting Arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Swollen feet and ankles Chest pain It's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider. How is diabetic heart disease diagnosed?

You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem. It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own. Diarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go. What causes diarrhea? The most common causes of diarrhea include: Bacteria from contaminated food or water Viruses such as the flu , norovirus , or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance . Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly. Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary. Who is at risk for diarrhea? People of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year. People who visit developing countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea . It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water. What other symptoms might I have with diarrhea? Other possible symptoms of diarrhea include: Cramps or pain in the abdomen An urgent need to use the bathroom Loss of bowel control If a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools. Diarrhea can cause dehydration , which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. When do I need to see a health care provider for diarrhea? Although it is usually not harmful, diarrhea can become dangerous or signal a more serious problem. Contact your health care provider if you have: Signs of dehydration Diarrhea for more than 2 days, if you are an adult. For children, contact the provider if it lasts more than 24 hours. Severe pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults) A fever of 102 degrees or higher Stools containing blood or pus Stools that are black and tarry If children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants. How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed? To find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may: Do a physical exam Ask about any medicines you are taking Test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection Ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away If you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease. What are the treatments for diarrhea? Diarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection. Adults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food. Children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Can diarrhea be prevented? Two types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses. You can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries: Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 768, "char_count": 4520, "synonyms": ["Dysentery", "The runs", "The trots"], "mesh_terms": ["Diarrhea"], "search_terms": ["dysentery", "diarrhea", "the trots", "the runs"], "quality_score": 80.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/diarrhea.html"},

A disability is any condition of your body or mind that makes it more difficult for you to do one or more major life activities and interact with the world around you. There are many types of disabilities, such as those that can affect your: Vision Hearing Movement Thinking Remembering Learning Communicating Development Mental health Social relationships More than 1 in 4 adults in the United States have some type of disability. Even though they all have disabilities, they can have a wide range of needs. For example, even people who have same type of disability can be affected in very different ways. Also, some disabilities are \"visible\" (easy to see), for example when someone is in a wheelchair. But other disabilities are \"invisible\" (hidden or not easy to see), such as problems with hearing, thinking, or learning. What causes disabilities? Disabilities can have different causes. Some disabilities are present at birth, while others may happen later in life. Causes of disabilities that are present at birth can include: Disorders in single genes , such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Disorders of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome Exposures (before birth) to infections or substances , such as drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes Causes of disabilities that happen later in life can include: Injuries, such as spinal cord injuries , traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), and back injuries Chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as diabetes , heart disease , kidney disease , COPD , and arthritis Cancer Mental health problems Stroke Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia How can disabilities affect your health? Having a disability does not mean a person cannot be healthy. In fact, many people with disabilities report that their health as good or better. But they may have or be at risk of health problems related to their disability, called \"secondary conditions.\" These conditions may include: Bowel or bladder problems Chronic pain Diabetes Fatigue Heart disease Injuries Mental health problems, including depression and substance use disorders Overweight and obesity Pressure sores or ulcers Many of these conditions can be prevented, and there are treatments for them. It's also important for people with disabilities to get health care that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability. How can people with disabilities get and stay healthy? Just like for people who don't have a disability, having a healthy lifestyle is important for people who do have a disability. A healthy lifestyle includes: Getting regular physical activity Eating healthy foods in healthy portions Limiting sun exposure and using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer Not smoking, and if needed, getting help to quit smoking Using medicines wisely Not drinking alcohol or drinking in moderation Getting help for any substance use or mental health problems Staying in touch with family and friends What kinds of resources are there for people with disabilities? Managing a disability can sometimes be challenging. There are resources that can help: Assistive devices and mobility aids can make daily tasks easier. Schools can develop plans around the specific needs of a child with a disability. The goal of the plans is to give the child an opportunity to perform at the same level as other children their age. Support networks, such as disability organizations, can help you learn more about resources for you and your family. Support groups can help you connect with other people who have the same disability. They can provide emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.

Your shoulder joint is made up of three bones: your collarbone, your shoulder blade, and your upper arm bone. The top of your upper arm bone is shaped like a ball. This ball fits into a cuplike socket in your shoulder blade. A shoulder dislocation is an injury that happens when the ball pops out of your socket. A dislocation may be partial, where the ball is only partially out of the socket. It can also be a full dislocation, where the ball is completely out of the socket. What causes a dislocated shoulder? Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They are also the most commonly dislocated joints. The most common causes of shoulder dislocations are: Sports injuries Accidents, including traffic accidents Falling on your shoulder or outstretched arm Seizures and electric shocks, which can cause muscle contractions that pull the arm out of place Who is at risk for a dislocated shoulder? A dislocated shoulder can happen to anyone, but they are more common in young men, who are more often involved in sports and other physical activities. Older adults, especially women, are also at higher risk because they are more likely to fall. What are the symptoms of a dislocated shoulder? The symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include: Severe shoulder pain Swelling and bruising of your shoulder or upper arm Numbness and/or weakness in your arm, neck, hand, or fingers Trouble moving your arm Your arm seems to be out of place Muscle spasms in your shoulder If you are having these symptoms, get medical treatment right away. How is a dislocated shoulder diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take a medical history and examine your shoulder. Your provider may also ask you to get an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis. What are the treatments for a dislocated shoulder? The treatment for dislocated shoulder usually involves three steps: The first step is a closed reduction, a procedure in which your health care provider puts the ball of your upper arm back into the socket. You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end. The second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks. The third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. You may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations. A dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again.

Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that bulge outward through weak spots in your colon. They mostly form in the lower part of the colon. Diverticulosis is a condition in which you have these pouches. Most people who have diverticulosis do not have symptoms or problems. But sometimes the pouches can cause symptoms or become inflamed. What is diverticulitis? Diverticulitis is the name for the condition you have when one or more of the pouches get inflamed. Diverticulitis may come on suddenly. It can sometimes cause serious health problems. What is diverticular disease? Diverticular disease is a condition that happens when the pouches cause: Chronic (long-term) symptoms Diverticular bleeding Diverticulitis or diverticulitis complications What causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Researchers aren't sure what causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis. They think certain factors may play a role in causing or increasing the risk for these conditions, including: Your genetics. Certain genes may make some people more likely to develop the conditions. Lifestyle factors such as: Diets low in fiber and high in red meat Lack of physical activity Taking certain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids Having obesity Smoking Researchers are also looking at other possible factors that may play a role in these conditions. Those factors include bacteria or stool (poop) getting caught in a pouch in your colon and changes in the microbiome in the intestines. Your microbiome is made up of the bacteria and other organisms in your intestines. Who is more likely to develop diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis is common, especially as people age. More than one-third of U.S. adults between the ages of 50 and 59 have diverticulosis. More than two-thirds who are over age 80 have it. Most of those people will not have symptoms or problems. But some of them will develop diverticulitis. What are the symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. But some people can have chronic symptoms such as: Bloating Constipation or diarrhea Cramping or pain in the lower abdomen (belly) Diverticulitis may cause acute symptoms such as: Abdominal pain, most often in the lower left side of your abdomen Constipation or diarrhea Fevers and chills Nausea or vomiting The pain caused by diverticulitis is usually severe and comes on suddenly. Less often, the pain may be mild and worsen over several days. What other problems can diverticulosis and diverticulitis cause? Some people with diverticulosis and diverticulitis may develop serious health problems (complications). Diverticular bleeding happens when a small blood vessel within the wall of a pouch bursts. The bleeding may be severe and sometimes even life-threatening. People with diverticulitis can also develop serious problems such as: Abscess , a painful, swollen, pus-filled area caused by infection Fistula , an abnormal opening or passage between the colon and another part of the body, such as the bladder or vagina Intestinal obstruction , a partial or total blockage that keeps food, fluids, air, or stool from moving through your intestines Perforation, or a hole, in your colon Peritonitis , an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity How are diverticulosis and diverticulitis diagnosed? Diverticulosis may be found when your health care provider is doing tests for another reason. Diverticulitis is usually found when you are having an acute attack. To make a diagnosis, your provider will review your medical history, do a physical exam, and order tests. The tests may include: Blood tests Stool tests Imaging tests such as CT scan , ultrasound , or MRI Colonoscopy What are the treatments for diverticulosis and diverticulitis? f your diverticulosis is causing chronic symptoms, your provider may recommend: High-fiber foods or fiber supplements Antibiotics Medicines to reduce inflammation Probiotics If you have diverticulitis without complications, your provider may recommend treatment at home. However, you probably need treatment in the hospital if you have severe diverticulitis, diverticulitis with complications, or a high risk for complications. Treatments for diverticulitis may include: Antibiotics, except for very mild cases. A clear liquid diet for a short time to rest the colon. Your provider may suggest slowly adding solid foods to your diet as your symptoms improve. Medicines for pain. This is usually acetaminophen instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs may increase the chance of diverticulitis complications. Antispasmodic medicines to relieve spasms. If your diverticulitis doesn't improve with treatment or if it causes complications, you may need surgery to remove part of your colon. Can diverticulitis be prevented?

Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. This extra copy changes how a baby's body and brain develop. It can cause both mental and physical challenges during their lifetime. Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person has different abilities. What causes Down syndrome? Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. In some cases, they may have an extra copy of part of the chromosome. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is called trisomy. So sometimes Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21. Down syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens by chance, as an error when cells are dividing during early development of the fetus . It is not known for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role. One factor that increases the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is the age of the mother. Women ages 35 and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome. What are the symptoms of Down syndrome? The symptoms of Down syndrome are different in each person. And people with Down syndrome may have different problems at different times of their lives. They usually have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Their development is often delayed . For example, they may start talking later than other children. Some of the common physical signs of Down syndrome include: A flat face Eyes that slant up A short neck Small hands and feet Poor muscle tone Loose joints What other problems does Down syndrome cause? Many people with Down syndrome have the common physical signs and have healthy lives. But some people with Down syndrome might have one or more birth defects or other health problems. Some of the more common ones include: Hearing loss Sleep apnea (a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep) Ear infections Eye diseases Congenital heart defects (heart defects that are present at birth) Digestive problems Problems with the upper part of the spine Obesity How is Down syndrome diagnosed? Health care providers can check for Down syndrome during pregnancy or after a child is born. There are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy : Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure. Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome. After a baby is born, the provider may make an initial diagnosis of Down syndrome based on the physical signs of the syndrome. The provider can use a karyotype genetic test to confirm the diagnosis. The test can check for extra chromosomes in a sample of the baby's blood. What are the treatments for Down syndrome? There is no single, standard treatment for Down syndrome. Treatments are based on each person's physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations. Services early in life focus on helping children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services include speech, occupational, and physical therapies. They are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are included in regular classes. Since people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care. They may need to have certain extra health screenings to check for problems that happen more often in people with Down syndrome.

For example: It moistens and breaks down the foods you eat, which makes it easier for you to chew and swallow. It washes away small food pieces from your teeth and gums, which helps fight against tooth decay . It contains minerals such as calcium and phosphate, which can also help fight tooth decay. It contains antibodies that can fight against infections of the mouth and throat. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria. What is dry mouth? Having dry mouth, also called xerostomia, means that you don't have enough saliva to keep your mouth wet. Everyone has a dry mouth once in a while, like when you are nervous or stressed. But if you have a dry mouth all or most of the time, it can be uncomfortable. It can make chewing, swallowing , and even talking difficult. It also raises your risk for tooth decay or infections in the mouth. What causes dry mouth? There are many possible causes of dry mouth, including: Side effects of certain medicines , such as some medicines for high blood pressure , depression , and bladder-control issues Diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome , HIV , salivary gland disorders , and diabetes Radiation therapy , which can damage your salivary glands if they are exposed to radiation during the treatment Chemotherapy , which can make your saliva thicker and cause your mouth to feel dry Nerve damage, when it involves the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva Breathing through your mouth Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other substances What are the symptoms of dry mouth? The symptoms of dry mouth may include: A sticky, dry feeling in your mouth Trouble chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking A burning feeling in your mouth A dry feeling in your throat Cracked lips A dry, rough tongue Mouth sores An infection in your mouth Bad breath How is the cause of dry mouth diagnosed? If you have dry mouth, it's important to find out the cause. To do that, your health care provider or dentist will review your medical history, examine your mouth, and ask about any medicines you take. They may also suggest blood tests or a test that measures how much saliva you produce. What are the treatments for dry mouth? Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause. For example, if a medicine is causing dry mouth, your provider or dentist may suggest adjusting the dosage or switching medicines. In some cases, they might give you artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better. There are also several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms: Drink plenty of water Avoid drinks with caffeine , which can dry out your mouth Chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow Avoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry Avoid alcohol and tobacco Using a humidifier at night Use a mouthwash made for dry mouth Since dry mouth can raise your risk of tooth decay, it's important to brush and floss your teeth regularly and see your dentist at least twice a year.

If you have a dual diagnosis, that means that you have both a mental disorder and a substance use disorder (SUD), either with alcohol or drugs . A dual diagnosis is a type of comorbidity, which is when someone has two disorders at the same time. Another name for this is co-occurring disorders. Mental and substance use disorders often occur together. Many people who develop SUDs are also diagnosed with mental disorders. And the reverse is true; many people with mental disorders will develop an SUD. Having both types of disorders is even more common in teenagers, people with serious mental illness, and people with certain mental disorders. Why do substance use disorders and mental disorders occur together? Although these problems often occur together, this does not mean that one caused the other, even if one appeared first. In fact, it can be hard to figure out which came first. Researchers think that there are three possible reasons as to why they often occur together: Common risk factors can contribute to both mental disorders and SUDs. These factors include: Genetics. Stress . Trauma, especially in childhood. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also at risk for SUDs Mental disorders can contribute to drug use and SUDs. For example, people with mental disorders may use drugs or alcohol to try to feel better temporarily. This is known as self-medication. Also, mental disorders may change the brain to make it more likely that you will become addicted. Substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of a mental disorder. Substance use may change the brain in ways that make you more likely to develop a mental disorder. What are the treatments for dual diagnosis? If you have a dual diagnosis, it is usually better to treat both conditions at the same time rather than separately. You and your health care provider can work on a treatment plan that fits your needs.The plan should take into account your age, which substance(s) you are misusing, and which specific mental disorder(s) you have.

It is a rare and often deadly disease. It can be caused by several different types of Ebola viruses. There are occasional outbreaks of Ebola, and they mostly occur in Africa. How does Ebola spread? Researchers believe that the virus first spreads from an infected animal to a human. Ebola can then spread from human to human through direct contact with: Blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Objects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment) contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Semen (through oral, vaginal, or anal sex) from a man who has recovered from Ebola. The virus can remain in semen and other body fluids, even if the person no longer has symptoms. When people become infected with Ebola, they do not start developing signs or symptoms right away. They cannot spread Ebola to others until after they develop symptoms. What are the symptoms of Ebola? The symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The average is about 8 to 10 days. The symptoms usually include: Fever Headache Joint and muscle aches Weakness and fatigue Sore throat Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal (belly) pain , diarrhea , and vomiting Loss of appetite Unexplained bleeding or bruising Other symptoms may include a rash , red eyes, and hiccups. How is Ebola diagnosed? The early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other more common diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. If a person has the symptoms of Ebola and may have been exposed to the virus, the health care provider can do a blood test for Ebola. It can take a few days after the symptoms start before Ebola shows up in the blood test. What are the treatments for Ebola? In the United States, there are two approved medicines to treat Ebola that is caused by one specific type of virus ( Zaire ebolavirus ). These medicines have not been evaluated to treat Ebola caused by other types of Ebola viruses. The medicines are monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins that are created in the lab. Whether or not there are medicines to treat a case of Ebola, there is supportive care. This type of care can improve the chances of survival, especially when given early. Supportive care includes: Giving fluids and electrolytes Giving medicines to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain Giving oxygen Treating any other complications or infections People who recover may still have side effects afterwards, such as fatigue, muscle aches, eye and vision problems , and stomach pain. Can Ebola be prevented? In the United States, there is one vaccine that has been approved to prevent Ebola caused by one specific type of Ebola virus ( Zaire ebolavirus ). It may be given to health care providers who will be or may be treating Ebola patients and people who work with live Ebola virus in labs. If you live in or plan to travel to a region where Ebola virus may be present, you can help protect yourself by avoiding contact with: Blood and body fluids of people who are sick Semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen Items that could be contaminated with blood or body fluids from someone who has Ebola Bats, forest antelopes, and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), including their blood, fluids, or meat Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 631, "char_count": 3629, "synonyms": ["Ebola disease", "Ebola hemorrhagic fever", "Ebola virus disease"], "mesh_terms": ["Ebolavirus", "Ebola Vaccines", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola"], "search_terms": ["ebola virus disease", "ebola", "ebola hemorrhagic fever", "ebola vaccines", "hemorrhagic fever, ebola", "ebola disease", "ebolavirus"], "quality_score": 82.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ebola.html"},

In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place outside the uterus. It usually occurs in the fallopian tubes. These tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy can occur in the ovaries, abdominal cavity, or the lower part of the uterus (cervix). Ectopic pregnancies can't end in a healthy pregnancy because the egg cannot grow. If the pregnancy continues, the fallopian tube can burst. This can cause internal bleeding, which can be a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate surgery. What increases my risk of an ectopic pregnancy? An ectopic pregnancy often happens because there is a problem with your fallopian tubes. But sometimes it's not clear why an ectopic pregnancy happens. Factors that may increase your risk for an ectopic pregnancy can include: Previous ectopic pregnancy Prior pelvic, abdominal, or fallopian tube surgery Certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometriosis Becoming pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control Becoming pregnant after a tubal ligation Other factors that may increase your risk can include: Smoking Being older than age 35 Infertility treatments What are the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy? You may not notice any symptoms at first. Or you may have some of the usual signs of pregnancy such as a missed period , breast tenderness, or nausea. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy may be light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency. Get medical care right away if you have these signs: Abdominal (belly) pain Shoulder pain Vaginal bleeding Feeling dizzy or faint How is an ectopic pregnancy diagnosed? An ectopic pregnancy can't be diagnosed without blood tests and an ultrasound . Your health care provider will do a pregnancy test to confirm that you're pregnant. They may do a pelvic exam to check for areas of pain, tenderness, or a mass. What is the treatment for an ectopic pregnancy? An ectopic pregnancy needs treatment to stop any damage to your organs. Your provider will use medicine or surgery to take out the ectopic tissue. Losing a pregnancy can be devastating. An ectopic pregnancy is like a miscarriage , but it must be treated to prevent problems. People cope with grief in different ways.

Some people worry that cell (wireless) phones cause cancer or other health problems. The phones do give off radiofrequency energy (RF), a form of electromagnetic radiation. So far, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. However, scientists need to do more research on this before they can say for sure.

It can happen when an infection or medical condition that affects the brain activates your immune system. The inflammation can cause a wide range of symptoms. In extreme cases, it can lead to brain damage, stroke , or even death. What causes encephalitis? There are different types of encephalitis, based on what the cause is. The two main types are infectious encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis is usually caused by a virus . In fact, viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. Some of the different viruses that cause it include: Herpes viruses, including herpes simplex (HSV), the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis ) and the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox ). Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected tick , such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE virus) and Powassan virus. Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected mosquito , such as eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus , and La Crosse virus. Enteroviruses, which are a common group of viruses that mostly cause mild illness or respiratory infection. These infections usually happen in the summer and fall. Bacteria , fungi , and parasites can also cause infectious encephalitis. But this is not common. Autoimmune encephalitis happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells. It can be triggered by conditions such as certain cancers, benign tumors , and infections. Sometimes the cause is not known. Who is more likely to get encephalitis? Anyone can get encephalitis, but you are more likely to get it if you: Have a weakened immune system, for example from having HIV or taking certain medicines. These could include medicines taken after an organ transplant , certain chemotherapy medicines, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases . Are a young child or older adult. Live in areas where there are ticks and mosquitoes that carry viruses that can cause encephalitis. What are the symptoms of encephalitis? The symptoms of encephalitis can vary a lot, depending on how severe it is. Many people do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild flu-like symptoms such as fever , fatigue , headache , or body aches. If encephalitis becomes more serious, it can cause: Severe headache Stiff neck Vomiting Seizures Behavior changes Drowsiness Muscle weakness Partial paralysis in your arms and legs Coma Encephalitis can be dangerous in infants. Their symptoms may include: Fever Lethargy (weakness or drowsiness) Poor feeding Vomiting Body stiffness Unusual irritability or crying A full or bulging fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head) If you or your child is having symptoms of encephalitis, it's important to get medical care right away. How is encephalitis diagnosed? To find out if you have encephalitis, your health care provider: Will do a physical exam Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms May do a neurologic exam May order imaging tests , such as a brain CT scan or MRI May order an EEG (electroencephalography), which use small electric sensors to measure your brain activity May order blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests What are the treatments for encephalitis? Most people with encephalitis will need treatment in the hospital. Depending on the cause, treatments may include antiviral medicines, antibiotics , corticosteroids , and other medicines. For some types of encephalitis, there is no medicine to treat it. But rest, nutrition, and fluids can help your body fight the infection and relieve symptoms. Some people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control. Can encephalitis be prevented? There are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis that is caused by infections: Use good hygiene , including washing your hands often with soap and water. Don't share food, drinks, utensils, and glasses with other people. Get vaccines for viruses that can cause encephalitis. Avoid mosquito and tick bites, for example by: Wearing insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Make sure to follow the instructions for using the repellant. Wearing clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet.

Surgery is the only way to know for sure that you have endometriosis. First, however, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will have a pelvic exam and may have some imaging tests . The most common surgery to diagnose endometriosis is a laparoscopy . This is a type of surgery that uses a laparoscope, a thin tube with a camera and light. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope through a small cut in the skin near your belly button. Your provider can make a diagnosis based on how the patches of endometriosis look. They may also do a biopsy to get a tissue sample. What are the treatments for endometriosis? There is no cure for endometriosis, but there are treatments for the symptoms. Your provider will work with you to decide which treatments would be best for you. Treatments for endometriosis pain include: Pain relievers , including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and a prescription medicine specifically for endometriosis. Providers may sometimes prescribe opioids for severe pain. Hormone therapy , which stops the ovaries from making hormones. This may slow the growth of the endometrial tissue and may stop new areas from growing. Types of hormone therapy include: Birth control pills . Progestin therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) medicines (GnRH agonists and antagonists). These medicines cause a temporary menopause .

Children who are born with FASD can have a mix of problems, such as medical, behavioral, educational, and social problems. The kinds of problems they have depend on which type of FASD they have. The problems could include : Abnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip Small head size Shorter-than-average height Low body weight Poor coordination Hyperactive behavior Difficulty with attention and memory Learning disabilities and difficulty in school Speech and language delays Intellectual disability or low IQ Poor reasoning and judgment skills Sleep and sucking problems as a baby Vision or hearing problems Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most serious type of FASD.

There is no cure, but treatments can help with the symptoms. What causes fibromyalgia? The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Studies of the brains of people with fibromyalgia found that they seem to process pain differently than people who don't have it. They may feel pain when others do not, and they may also have a more severe reaction to pain. Fibromyalgia can run in families, so genetics may also play a role. Other factors may also be involved, such as having certain diseases that cause pain. Who is at risk for fibromyalgia? Anyone can get fibromyalgia, but it is more common in: Women; they are twice as likely to have fibromyalgia Middle-aged people; your chance of having it increases as you get older People with certain diseases, such as lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis People who have a family member with fibromyalgia What are the symptoms of fibromyalgia? The main symptoms of fibromyalgia are: Chronic (long-lasting) pain and stiffness all over the body. People often describe it as aching, burning, or throbbing. Fatigue and tiredness. Trouble sleeping . Other symptoms may include: Problems with thinking, memory, and concentration (sometimes called \"fibro fog\") Muscle and joint stiffness Numbness or tingling in the arms and legs Sensitivity to light, noise, odors, and temperature People who have fibromyalgia are also more likely to have certain diseases, including: Anxiety Depression Headaches , including migraines Irritable bowel syndrome Pain in the face or jaw, including disorders of the jaw know as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) How is fibromyalgia diagnosed? Fibromyalgia can be hard to diagnose. It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis . To find out if you have fibromyalgia, your provider: Will take your medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptoms Will do a physical exam May order x-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions What are the treatments for fibromyalgia? Not all providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a provider or team of providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, so treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms. Providers usually use a combination of treatments, including medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies: Medicines Certain antidepressants and anti-seizure medicines, which may help with pain or sleep problems. Pain relievers . Lifestyle changes Getting enough sleep . Getting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you. Learning how to manage stress . Learning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest. Talk therapy , such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too. Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your provider first. These therapies include: Mindfulness meditation. Biofeedback, which uses electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate.

Fifth disease, also called erythema infectiosum, is a viral infection caused by parvovirus B19. This virus only infects people; it's not the same type of parvovirus that dogs and cats can get. Fifth disease mostly affects children. It often causes a bright red rash on their cheeks (sometimes called a \"slapped cheek\" rash). In the United States, parvovirus B19 infections are more common in late winter, spring, and early summer. There are usually minor outbreaks of fifth disease about every 3 to 4 years. What causes fifth disease? Parvovirus B19, which causes fifth disease, can spread from person to person: Through respiratory droplets, such as saliva (spit), sputum, or nasal mucus. The droplets can spread when: Someone who has the virus coughs and sneezes You touch an item that has the virus on it Through blood or blood products From a pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy You are most contagious early in your infection, when you usually only have a fever or cold-like symptoms. You are not likely to be contagious after you get later symptoms such as a rash and joint pain. What are the symptoms of fifth disease? About 2 out of 10 people who get a B19 parvovirus infection will have no symptoms. But most people will get the symptoms of fifth disease, which are usually mild and can include: Fever Headache Cough Sore throat Rashes Joint pain The \"slapped cheek\" rash is more common in children. They usually get the rash a few days after they first have other symptoms. The rash can then spread to the arms, legs, chest, back, and buttocks. Adults who get fifth disease might also have joint pain and swelling (called polyarthropathy syndrome). Sometimes the infection can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system. This is more likely to happen if you are pregnant, have a blood disorder such as anemia , or a weakened immune system . Because of these risks to you and some possible risks to your baby, contact your health care provider if you are pregnant and: You show signs of fifth disease (or a \"slapped cheek\" rash) You may have been exposed to someone who has the infection How is fifth disease diagnosed? There is no routine lab test to diagnose fifth disease. Providers can often diagnose fifth disease just by seeing the \"slapped cheek\" rash and rashes on the body. There is testing to show whether or not you have protection (immunity) against the B19 parvovirus or if you have had a recent infection. This test is usually not needed, but your provider may order the test if you are pregnant or at higher risk for complications of the disease. What are the treatments for fifth disease? There is no specific treatment for fifth disease. It is usually mild and goes away on its own. To feel better, get plenty of rest. Taking acetaminophen can help with the fever and pain. Do not give aspirin to children, because it may cause Reye syndrome . This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver. Can fifth disease be prevented? There is no vaccine to prevent fifth disease. But you can help protect yourself and others by: Washing your hands often with soap and water Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Staying home when you are sick Most people become immune to the virus after having it once.

For example, \"stomach flu\" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis . What other problems can the flu cause? Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include: Bronchitis Ear infection Sinus infection Pneumonia Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain ( encephalitis ), or muscle tissues ( myositis , rhabdomyolysis) The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu. Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including: Adults 65 and older Pregnant women Children younger than 5 People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease How is the flu diagnosed? To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu . For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus. Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours. What are the treatments for the flu? Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care. But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick. Can the flu be prevented? The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.

{"chunk_id": "6236_1", "topic_id": "6236", "topic_title": "Flu Shot", "content": "What is the flu? The flu (influenza) is a respiratory infection. It is caused by influenza viruses that infect your nose, throat, and lungs. These viruses can spread from person to person. Most people with the flu get better on their own, without medical care. But for some people, the flu is serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. People who are 65 and older, under age 5, pregnant, or have certain health conditions are at higher risk of flu complications. Getting vaccinated against the flu each year is best way to lower your risk of the flu and its complications. What are the benefits of getting a flu shot? There are many reasons to get a flu shot each year: It may keep you from getting sick with the flu. If you do get the flu, it may be less severe. You may also be less likely to have complications or need to be hospitalized with the flu. If you have certain chronic health conditions, getting a flu shot may help prevent the flu from making your condition worse. For example, if you have COPD or diabetes , the flu can worsen your condition so much that you might need to be hospitalized. Getting a flu shot can lower this risk. Getting the vaccine during pregnancy not only helps protect you from the flu during and after pregnancy. It also helps protect your baby from flu during their first few months of life. It has been shown to lower the risk of severe life-threatening flu in children. It may also protect the people around you, including those who are at higher risk of complications. How do flu shots work? The flu vaccine causes your immune system to make antibodies about two weeks after you get the shot. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the flu viruses that are in the vaccine. Who needs a flu shot? The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, with a few rare exceptions. Flu shots are especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu. There are different types of flu vaccines. There are injectable vaccines (shots) and nasal spray vaccines. There are also some vaccines especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. Who should not get a flu shot? There are some people who should not get a flu shot: Children younger than 6 months of age. Have severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. Some people need to talk to their provider before they get a flu shot. They include people who: Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Have ever had Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Some people with a history of GBS should not get a flu vaccine. If you are moderately or severely ill, you usually need to wait until you recover before getting a flu shot. Why do I need a flu shot every year? You need to get a flu shot every year because: Your immune protection from the vaccine declines over time. You need to get the shot every year to boost that protection. Flu viruses are constantly changing, so every year, the flu vaccine is updated. The flu vaccine will include protection against the viruses that will most likely be common during the upcoming flu season. When should I get the flu shot? For most people who need only one dose of the flu vaccine for the season, September and October are usually good times to get it. It's best to be vaccinated by the end of October. Some children need two doses of the flu vaccine. They should get their first dose as soon as the vaccine is available. They need to get the second dose at least four weeks after the first. If you are pregnant, talk to your provider about when to get the vaccine. When you should get it can vary, based on how far along you are in your pregnancy. Do flu shots cause side effects? Flu vaccines have been shown to be safe. But like any medical product, they can cause side effects. If you have any side effects, they are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Common side effects include: Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot Headache Fever Nausea Muscle aches The flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting .

Electrolytes are minerals that have an electric charge when they are dissolved in water or body fluids, including blood. The electric charge can be positive or negative. You have electrolytes in your blood, urine (pee), tissues, and other body fluids. Electrolytes are important because they help: Balance the amount of water in your body Balance your body's acid/base (pH) level Move nutrients into your cells Move wastes out of your cells Support your muscle and nerve function Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady Keep your blood pressure stable Keep your bones and teeth healthy What are the different types of electrolytes in your body? The main electrolytes in your body include: Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance (pH). It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Calcium , which helps make and keep bones and teeth strong. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Magnesium, which helps your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. It also helps control blood pressure and blood glucose (blood sugar). Phosphate, which works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Potassium , which helps your cells, heart, and muscles work properly. Sodium , which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. You get these electrolytes from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink. What is an electrolyte imbalance? An electrolyte imbalance means that the level of one or more electrolytes in your body is too low or too high. It can happen when the amount of water in your body changes. The amount of water that you take in should equal the amount you lose. If something upsets this balance, you may have too little water ( dehydration ) or too much water (overhydration). Some of the more common reasons why you might have an imbalance of the water in your body include: Certain medicines Severe vomiting and/or diarrhea Heavy sweating Heart , liver or kidney problems Not drinking enough fluids, especially when doing intense exercise or when the weather is very hot Drinking too much water What are the different types of electrolyte imbalances? The names of the different types of electrolyte imbalances are: Electrolyte Too low Too high Bicarbonate Acidosis Alkalosis Calcium Hypocalcemia Hypercalcemia Chloride Hypochloremia Hyperchloremia Magnesium Hypomagnesemia Hypermagnesemia Phosphate Hypophosphatemia Hyperphosphatemia Potassium Hypokalemia Hyperkalemia Sodium Hyponatremia Hypernatremia How are electrolyte imbalances diagnosed? A test called an electrolyte panel can check the levels of your body's main electrolytes. A related test, the anion gap blood test , checks whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough. What are the treatments for electrolyte imbalances? The treatment for an electrolyte imbalance depends on which electrolytes are out of balance, if there is too little or too many, and what is causing the imbalance. In minor cases, you may just need to make some changes to your diet. In other cases, you may need other treatments. For example: If you don't have enough of an electrolyte, you may get electrolyte replacement therapy. This involves giving you more of that electrolyte. It could be a medicine or supplement that you swallow or drink, or it may be given intravenously (by IV). If you have too much of an electrolyte, your provider may give you medicines or fluids (by mouth or by IV) to help remove that electrolyte from your body. In severe cases, you may need dialysis to filter out the electrolyte.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 610, "char_count": 3760, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Water-Electrolyte Balance", "Water-Electrolyte Imbalance"], "search_terms": ["fluid and electrolyte balance", "water-electrolyte balance", "water-electrolyte imbalance"], "quality_score": 62.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/fluidandelectrolytebalance.html"},

Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture. The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern. The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse. Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures. What causes fractures? Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls , or sports injuries . Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures. Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone. What are the symptoms of a fracture? The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include: Intense pain Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury Trouble moving the injured part If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away. How are fractures diagnosed? To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken. What are the treatments for fractures? The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals.

It can be caused by many different viruses, including noroviruses and rotaviruses . Some people call viral gastroenteritis the \"stomach flu.\" But this name is not medically correct. It is not caused by flu viruses. The flu is a respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat and lungs. When gastroenteritis is caused by consuming foods or drinks contaminated with viruses, bacteria, parasites, or chemicals, this is called food poisoning . The viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause gastroenteritis can also spread from person to person. You could be infected when you touch something that has the germs on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. What are the symptoms of gastroenteritis? The symptoms of gastroenteritis include: Diarrhea Pain or cramping in your abdomen (belly) Nausea Vomiting Sometimes fever Gastroenteritis is usually not serious.

Genes are sections of DNA in your cells that are passed down (inherited) from your parents. You inherit two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. There are about 20,000 genes that provide instructions for making proteins, which your body needs to work correctly. Some genes don't make proteins themselves but instead help control how other genes work. They act like switches, turning other genes on or off. This means they help decide when, where, and how much of a protein is made in your body. What happens when genes change? Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. These changes can be inherited, occur as you age, or result from environmental factors such as chemicals or radiation. Often, these changes have no effect, but sometimes, even a small change in the DNA can alter the instructions for making proteins. If genes don't make the right proteins, or don't make them correctly, this can cause a genetic disorder . What is gene therapy? Gene therapy uses genes to treat or prevent disease by correcting genetic problems. It works by changing your genetic material, rather than relying on traditional treatments like medicine or surgery. New genetic material can be delivered into cells in two main ways: ex-vivo treatment . Cells are removed from your body, modified by adding genetic material, and then placed back into your body. in-vivo treatment . Genetic material is delivered directly into your body, often through an injection. A common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches include: Repairing an abnormal gene Altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off Newer techniques offer different ways to correct genetic problems: Genome editing (also called gene editing). Instead of adding new genetic material into cells, this approach changes the DNA that's already in your cells. A well-known example is CRISPR-Cas9. This promising technique is still being studied and may soon be used to treat genetic disorders. Cell-based gene therapy combines gene therapy and cell therapy. An example of this would be CAR T cell therapy. Cells, which are often immune system cells, are genetically altered to help treat a disease and then introduced into the body. Gene therapies are currently only approved to treat a small number of diseases, such as: Leber congenital amaurosis , an inherited eye disorder. Spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle disorder. What are the risks and challenges of gene therapy? While gene therapy holds great promise, it comes with risks and challenges. Studies are still ongoing to ensure these treatments are safe and effective. Some challenges include: Immune system reactions. Your body may see the new material as a threat and react to it.

Genetic disorders are health conditions caused by changes (also called mutations or variants) in your genes. Genes are parts of DNA found in your cells that carry instructions for how your body grows, develops, and functions. Many genes tell your body how to make proteins, which are needed for your body to work properly. What causes genetic disorders? A genetic disorder happens when a gene variant changes how a protein is made. The variant may cause the protein to work poorly or not be made at all. If genes don't make the right proteins, or don't make them correctly, it can lead to a genetic disorder. Not all gene changes cause disease. Often, these changes have no effect. But sometimes, even a small change in DNA can affect how proteins are made. Gene variants can be grouped into two main types: Inherited variants (also called germline variants) are passed down from your parents. They come from egg or sperm cells. Non-inherited (also called somatic variants) are not passed down from your parents. They happen during your lifetime. They may be caused by things like harmful chemicals or ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. What are the types of genetic disorders? Genetic disorders may be caused by: Single gene disorders are caused by changes in one gene. Examples can include sickle cell anemia , where a change in a single gene can cause the condition, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease , where a variant in one of many different genes can cause the condition. Chromosomal disorders are caused by missing, extra, or altered chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures that carry genes. These disorders involve changes in the number of chromosomes people have or changes in the structure of one or more chromosomes. An example is Down syndrome , which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Complex (multifactorial) disorders are caused by changes in many genes. Each change alone may not cause the disease, but together they increase the risk. Lifestyle and environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, or exposure to pollutants, also play a role. Colon cancer is an example. What are the different ways a genetic disorder can be inherited? Some genetic conditions are passed down through families (inherited) in one of several patterns, depending on the specific gene involved. Patterns of inheritance can include: Dominant means you only need one changed gene to cause the condition. Recessive means you need two changed copies of the gene (one from each parent) for the condition to occur. X-linked conditions involve genes located on the X chromosome. These conditions often affect males more frequently. Mitochondrial conditions are passed down by the mother. How are genetic disorders diagnosed?

{"chunk_id": "42_1", "topic_id": "42", "topic_title": "Glaucoma", "content": "What is glaucoma? Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the optic nerve of one, or both, of your eyes. This can result in vision loss . There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common type is open-angle glaucoma. Other less common types include angle-closure glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma. You may not have any symptoms of glaucoma. Regular eye exams by an eye care provider can check for glaucoma and other eye problems to help protect your vision. Treatments that lower eye pressure help slow the disease. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness. What causes glaucoma? Medical experts aren't sure what causes glaucoma, but the most common types usually happen when the fluid pressure inside your eye slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Other types of glaucoma may be caused by medical conditions, or a baby may be born with it. Not everyone with high eye pressure develops glaucoma. Some people may even get glaucoma with normal eye pressure. The amount of pressure your optic nerve can handle is different for each person. Getting regular dilated eye exams helps your provider figure out what level of eye pressure is normal for you. What are the symptoms of glaucoma? Often there are no symptoms of glaucoma at first. Or symptoms may start so slowly that you may not notice them. Without treatment, you slowly lose your peripheral (side) vision. It may seem like you're looking through a tunnel. Over time, your straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. If you have sudden symptoms of intense eye pain, blurry vision, red eyes, or an upset stomach (nausea), you need to go to your eye care provider or an emergency room right away. These could be symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma. This less common type of glaucoma causes fluid to build up quickly in your eye. How is glaucoma diagnosed? A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. This would include: A dilated eye exam . This involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter your eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye to check for glaucoma or other eye problems. For a few hours after the exam your vision may be blurry and sensitive to light, so you will need someone to take you home. Visual field testing . This check of your peripheral (side) vision allows your eye care provider to find out how well you can see objects off to the side of your vision without moving your eyes. Tonometry . This measures the pressure inside your eye. If you're at higher risk for glaucoma, you should get comprehensive eye exams every one to two years. You're at higher risk if you: Are Black or African American and over age 40 Are over age 60, especially if you're Hispanic or Latino Have a family history of glaucoma You're also at higher risk if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Talk with your provider about your risk and how often you should get your eyes checked. What are the treatments for glaucoma? Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Without treatment it can eventually cause blindness. Treatments can include: Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment to lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve. Other treatments may include oral medicines, laser treatment, and/or surgery. A combination of these treatments may be used to lower eye pressure and help drain the fluid out of your eye. Can glaucoma be prevented? There is no way to prevent glaucoma. Eye exams can help find glaucoma or other eye problems before they can affect your vision. If you have glaucoma, be sure to continue with treatment to prevent your vision from getting worse.

It is an important part of your long-term health. Making sure that you hold your body the right way, whether you are moving or still, can prevent pain, injuries, and other health problems. What is posture? Posture is how you hold your body. There are two types: Dynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving, like when you are walking, running, or bending over to pick up something. Static posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving, like when you are sitting, standing, or sleeping. It is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture. The key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck, mid back, and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves, but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders, and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips. How can posture affect my health? Poor posture can be bad for your health. Slouching or slumping over can: Misalign your musculoskeletal system Wear away at your spine, making it more fragile and prone to injury Cause neck, shoulder, and back pain Decrease your flexibility Affect how well your joints move Affect your balance and increase your risk of falling Make it harder to digest your food Make it harder to breathe How can I improve my posture in general? Be mindful of your posture during everyday activities, like watching television, washing dishes, or walking Stay active. Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture, but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga, tai chi, and other classes that focus on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles, cause problems for your pelvis and spine, and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture. Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. High heels, for example, can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture. Make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you, whether you're sitting in front of a computer, making dinner, or eating a meal. How can I improve my posture when sitting? Many Americans spend a lot of their time sitting - either at work, at school, or at home. It is important to sit properly, and to take frequent breaks: Switch sitting positions often Take brief walks around your office or home Gently stretch your muscles every so often to help relieve muscle tension Don't cross your legs; keep your feet on the floor, with your ankles in front of your knees Make sure that your feet touch the floor, or if that's not possible, use a footrest Relax your shoulders; they should not be rounded or pulled backwards Keep your elbows in close to your body. They should be bent between 90 and 120 degrees. Make sure that your back is fully supported. Use a back pillow or other back support if your chair does not have a backrest that can support your lower back's curve. Make sure that your thighs and hips are supported. You should have a well-padded seat, and your thighs and hips should be parallel to the floor. How can I improve my posture when standing?

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease . What are HDL and LDL? HDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. How do I know what my HDL level is? A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger: : The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are age 20 or older: : Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years What should my HDL level be? With HDL cholesterol, higher numbers are better, because a high HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke . How high your HDL should be depends on your age and sex: Group Healthy HDL Level Age 19 or younger More than 45mg/dl Men age 20 or older More than 40mg/dl Women age 20 or older More than 50mg/dl How can I raise my HDL level? If your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall: Eat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist. Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days. Avoid cigarettes. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit . You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level.

Head and neck cancer is the name for cancers that develop in the mouth , nose and sinuses , salivary glands , and throat and voice box (larynx). Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell cancers . They begin in the moist tissues that line the head and neck. The cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. There are other cancers that develop in the head and neck, such as brain cancer , eye cancer , and esophageal cancer . But they are usually not considered to be head and neck cancers, because those types of cancer and their treatments are different. Who is more likely to develop head and neck cancer? Anyone can get head and neck cancer, but you are more likely to develop it if you: Use tobacco or drink lots of alcohol. Your risk of developing head and neck cancer is even higher if you do both.

Possible exams and tests may include: A physical exam of the area that might have cancer. Blood and/or urine tests. An endoscopy . A biopsy or other procedure to collect cells from the area that might have cancer. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. Imaging tests . What are the treatments for head and neck cancer? The treatment for head and neck cancer will depend on the specific type of cancer, the stage (how advanced the cancer is), your overall health, and other factors. The treatment options might include: Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Cancer immunotherapy Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells In some cases, you may need a combination of treatments. Sometimes surgery can affect how well you can chew, swallow, or talk. Rehabilitation, such as physical therapy, dietary counseling, and speech therapy, may help.

{"chunk_id": "272_1", "topic_id": "272", "topic_title": "Head Lice", "content": "What are head lice? Head lice are tiny insects that live on people's heads. Adult lice are about the size of sesame seeds. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a dandruff flake. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears. Head lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are body lice and pubic lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. How do head lice spread? Lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They spread by close person-to-person contact. Rarely, they can spread through sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Personal hygiene and cleanliness have nothing to do with getting head lice. You also cannot get pubic lice from animals. Head lice do not spread disease. Who is at risk for head lice? Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. This is because young children often have head-to-head contact while playing together. What are the symptoms of head lice? The symptoms of head lice include: Tickling feeling in the hair Frequent itching, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites Sores from scratching. Sometimes the sores can become infected with bacteria. Trouble sleeping, because head lice are most active in the dark How do you know if you have head lice? A diagnosis of head lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. Because they are very small and move quickly, you may need to use a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb to find lice or nits. What are the treatments for head lice? Treatments for head lice include both over-the-counter and prescription shampoos, creams, and lotions. If you want to use an over-the-counter treatment and you aren't sure which one to use or how to use one, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. You should also check with your health care provider first if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you want to use a treatment on a young child. Follow these steps when using a head lice treatment: Apply the product according to the instructions. Only apply it to the scalp and the hair attached to the scalp. You should not use it on other body hair. Use only one product at a time, unless your health care provider tells you to use two different kinds at once Pay attention to what the instructions say about how long you should leave the medicine on the hair and on how you should rinse it out After rinsing, use a fine-toothed comb or special \"nit comb\" to remove dead lice and nits After each treatment, check your hair for lice and nits. You should comb your hair to remove nits and lice every 2-3 days. Do this for 2-3 weeks to be sure that all lice and nits are gone. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. If an over-the-counter treatment does not work for you, you can ask your health care provider for a prescription product. Can head lice be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent the spread of lice. If you already have lice, besides treatment, you should: Wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer Soak your combs and brushes in hot water for 5-10 minutes Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where you sat or lay If there are items that you cannot wash, seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks To prevent your children from spreading lice: Teach children to avoid head-to-head contact during play and other activities Teach children not to share clothing and other items that they put on their head, such as headphones, hair ties, and helmets If your child has lice, be sure to check the policies at school and/or daycare. Your child may not be able to go back until the lice have been completely treated. There is no clear scientific evidence that lice can be suffocated by home remedies, such as mayonnaise, olive oil, or similar substances. You also should not use kerosene or gasoline; they are dangerous and flammable.

Being either overweight or underweight can lead to health problems. Ask your health care professional what a healthy weight for you may be. Healthy eating and exercise can help you get to that weight. Keeping your mind active. Lots of activities can keep your mind active and improve your memory , including learning new skills, reading, and playing games. Making your mental health a priority. Work on improving your mental health , for example by practicing mediation, relaxation techniques, or gratitude. Know the warning signs of a problem and ask for help if you are struggling. Participating in activities that you enjoy. People who are involved in hobbies and social and leisure activities may be at lower risk for some health problems. Doing things that you enjoy may help you feel happier and improve your thinking abilities. Playing an active role in your health care. Make sure that you get regular checkups and the health screenings that you need. You should know which medicines you are taking, why you need them, and how to take them properly . Not smoking. If you are a smoker, quitting is one of the most important things that you can do for your health. It can lower your risk of several different types of cancer, certain lung diseases, and heart disease. Taking steps to prevent falls . Older adults have a higher risk of falling. They are also more likely to fracture (break) a bone when they fall. Getting regular eye checkups , getting regular physical activity, and making your house safer can lower your risk of falling. Following these tips can help you to stay healthy as you age. Even if you have never done them before, it's never too late to start taking care of your health.

A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack. The most common symptoms in men and women are: Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain . It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason. The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis . It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery. A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests . Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty . After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease. What are the types of heart disease? There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, called congenital heart disease . Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems: Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flow Heart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Other types of heart diseases may affect your heart valves or heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ). What causes heart diseases? The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases. Who is more likely to develop heart diseases? There are many different factors that can make you more likely to develop heart disease. Some of these factors you can change, but others you cannot. Age. Your risk of heart disease goes up as you get older. Sex. Some factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. Family history and genetics. A family history of early heart disease raises your risk. And research has shown that some genes are linked to a higher risk of certain heart diseases. Race/ethnicity. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. However, certain groups have higher risks than others. This includes Black people, White people, and American Indian/Alaska Native people. Lifestyle habits. Over time, unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk of heart disease. These can include: Eating a diet high in saturated fats , refined carbohydrates, and salt . Not getting enough physical activity . Drinking too much alcohol . Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke . Too much stress . Having other medical conditions can raise your risk of heart diseases. These conditions include: High blood pressure . High cholesterol levels . Diabetes . Obesity . Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Chronic kidney disease . Metabolic syndrome . What are the symptoms of heart disease? Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. You may not have symptoms at first. In some cases, you may not know you have heart disease until you have a complication such as a heart attack. How are heart diseases diagnosed? To find out if you have heart disease, your health care provider will: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had heart disease Do a physical exam Likely run heart tests and blood tests In some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.

Heart surgery can correct certain heart problems when other treatments haven't worked or can't be used. In some cases, heart surgery may be a medical emergency. For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker. What conditions does heart surgery treat? There are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions: What conditions does heart surgery treat? What does the heart surgery do? Coronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle. Makes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) , or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. Heart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart. Repairs heart valves. Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue. Arrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. Places a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat. Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery). Heart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Places a device in the chest which may include: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest . A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful. A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood. A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart. Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart ( heart transplantation ). Heart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts. Repairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric. Angina - chest pain from coronary artery disease. Uses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization). Damaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with. Repairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage. What approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery? The approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include: Open-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery. Off-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases. Minimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine. Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations. What are the risks of heart surgery? Like all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include: Bleeding Infection, fever , and swelling A problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery) Arrhythmia Damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs Stroke The risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if: The surgery is an emergency.

Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. There are two main types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. A hemorrhagic stroke is less common but often more severe. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding (hemorrhage) in or around the brain. This bleeding increases pressure inside the skull and damages brain tissue. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. What are the types of hemorrhagic stroke? Hemorrhagic strokes are classified by where the bleeding happens: Intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs directly into the brain tissue. This is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs in the space between the brain and the thin layers of tissues covering it. This often happens when a weak spot in an artery (called an aneurysm) bursts on the brain's surface. What causes hemorrhagic stroke? Common causes include: Aneurysm . A bulge or \"ballooning\" in a weakened artery wall that can burst. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A tangled group of abnormal blood vessels that can rupture inside the brain. High blood pressure (hypertension). Over time, it can weaken blood vessel walls and increase the risk of them breaking open. Head trauma. Brain injury can cause bleeding. What are the symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke? Stroke symptoms often happen suddenly. They include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause The F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke.

How is a hemorrhagic stroke diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider may do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms and medical history, and use imaging tests to check for bleeding in your brain. How is hemorrhagic stroke treated? It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. For a hemorrhagic stroke, the first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and stop it. Treatment may involve medicines or, in some cases, surgery to stop the bleeding or relieve pressure on the brain. After the stroke, rehabilitation can help people recover lost abilities and regain independence. Can a hemorrhagic stroke be prevented?

So it's important to see your provider to find the cause of the bleeding. How are hemorrhoids diagnosed? To find out if you have hemorrhoids, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history. Will do a physical exam. Often providers can diagnose external hemorrhoids by looking at the area around your anus. Will do a digital rectal exam to check for internal hemorrhoids. For this, the provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for anything that is abnormal. May do procedures such as an anoscopy to check for internal hemorrhoids. What are the treatments for hemorrhoids? If at-home treatments for hemorrhoids don't help you, you may need a medical procedure. There are several different procedures that your provider can do in the office. These procedures use different techniques to cause scar tissue to form in the hemorrhoids. This cuts off the blood supply, which usually shrinks the hemorrhoids. In severe cases, you may need surgery. Can hemorrhoids be prevented? You can help prevent hemorrhoids by: Eating foods that are high in fiber Taking a stool softener or a fiber supplement Drinking enough fluids every day Not straining during bowel movements Not sitting on the toilet for long periods of time", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 629, "char_count": 3788, "synonyms": ["Piles"], "mesh_terms": ["Hemorrhoidectomy", "Hemorrhoids"], "search_terms": ["hemorrhoids", "hemorrhoidectomy", "piles"], "quality_score": 69.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhoids.html"},

Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections. What causes hepatitis? There are different types of hepatitis, with different causes: Viral hepatitis is the most common type. It is caused by one of several viruses -- hepatitis viruses A , B , C , D, and E. In the United States, A, B, and C are the most common. Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by heavy alcohol use Toxic hepatitis can be caused by certain poisons, chemicals, medicines, or supplements Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic type in which your body's immune system attacks your liver. The cause is not known, but genetics and your environment may play a role. How is viral hepatitis spread? Hepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact with food or water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex. Who is at risk for hepatitis? The risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex. People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis. What are the symptoms of hepatitis? Some people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice , yellowing of your skin and eyes If you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later. What other problems can hepatitis cause? Chronic hepatitis can lead to complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and liver cancer . Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis may prevent these complications. How is hepatitis diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam Will likely do blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis Might do imaging tests , such as an ultrasound , CT scan , or MRI May need to do a liver biopsy to get a clear diagnosis and check for liver damage What are the treatments for hepatitis? Treatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital. There are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant . Can hepatitis be prevented? There are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis.

Thanks to a vaccine, hepatitis A is not very common in the United States. What causes hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus spreads through contact with an infected person's stool. This can happen if you: Eat food made by someone who has the virus and did not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom Drink contaminated water or eat foods that were rinsed with contaminated water Have close personal contact with someone who has hepatitis A. This could be through certain types of sex (like oral-anal sex), taking care of someone who is ill, or using illegal drugs with others. Who is at risk for hepatitis A?

Often, people with hepatitis B don't have symptoms. Adults and children over 5 are more likely to have symptoms than younger children. Some people with acute hepatitis B have symptoms 2 to 5 months after infection. These symptoms can include: Dark yellow urine Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Gray- or clay-colored stools Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may not have symptoms until complications develop. This could be decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis B screening is important, even if you have no symptoms. Screening means that you are tested for a disease even though you don't have symptoms. If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest screening. What other problems can hepatitis B cause? In rare cases, acute hepatitis B can cause liver failure. Chronic hepatitis B can develop into a serious disease that causes long-term health problems such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer , and liver failure. If you have ever had hepatitis B, the virus may become active again, or reactivated, later in life. This could start to damage the liver and cause symptoms. How is hepatitis B diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis B, your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam Blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis What are the treatments for hepatitis B? If you have acute hepatitis B, you probably don't need treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B don't need treatment. But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines. Can hepatitis B be prevented? The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the hepatitis B vaccine. You can also reduce your chance of hepatitis B infection by: Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools Not sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers Using a latex condom during sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. If you think you have been in contact with the hepatitis B virus, see your health care provider right away. Your provider may give you a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent infection. In some cases, your provider may also give you a medicine called hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). You need to get the vaccine and the HBIG (if needed) as soon as possible after coming into contact with the virus. It is best if you can get them within 24 hours.

It's made from morphine, which comes from the seedpod of opium poppy plants. These plants grow in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Heroin can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance known as black tar heroin. How do people use heroin? People inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack cocaine , which is called \"speedballing.\" All these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly, which makes it highly addictive. What are the short-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin report feeling a \"rush\" (a surge of pleasure). And then they may feel other effects, such as a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth , and a heavy feeling in the arms and legs. They may also have severe itching , nausea, and vomiting . After these first effects, they will usually be drowsy for several hours, and their breathing will slow down. What are the long-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin over the long term may develop many different health problems. These problems could include liver , kidney , and lung disease, mental disorders , and abscesses . People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases such as HIV , hepatitis , and bacterial infections of the skin, bloodstream, and heart ( endocarditis ). They can also get collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Repeated use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin. If someone who is dependent on heroin stops using it, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea , vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps. Repeated use of heroin often leads to heroin use disorder, sometimes called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use heroin even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using heroin becomes their main purpose in life. Can a person overdose on heroin? It's possible to overdose on heroin. This happens when a person uses so much heroin that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. All heroin users are at risk of an overdose because they never know the actual strength of the drug they are taking or what may have been added to it. Most heroin available in the United States is combined with illegally made fentanyl (IMF). Using heroin combined with IMF, or along with other drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of an overdose. When people overdose on heroin, their heart rate and breathing slow down. Their breathing may slow do so much that not enough oxygen reaches the brain. This condition is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can lead to a coma , permanent brain damage, or death. How can a heroin overdose be treated? A medicine called naloxone can treat a heroin (or other opioid) overdose if it is given in time. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid on the body. Sometimes more than one dose of the medicine is needed. There are two forms of naloxone that anyone can use without medical training: nasal spray and injectable. People at risk of an overdose are encouraged to carry naloxone with them. They can buy naloxone at a pharmacy. What are the treatments for heroin use disorder? Treatments for heroin use disorder include medicines to treat withdrawal symptoms, medicine to block the effects of opioids, and behavioral treatments. Often, a combination of medicine and behavioral treatment works best. People getting treatment for heroin use disorder should work with their health care providers to come up with a treatment plan that fits their needs.

Another name for it is acne inversa. It causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin. It often affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as your armpits and groin. The lumps become inflamed and painful. They often break open, causing abscesses that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they can cause scarring of the skin. What causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The lumps in HS form because of blockages of the hair follicles. The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, which leads to inflammation and rupture. In most cases, the cause of the blockages is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS are caused by changes in certain genes . HS is not caused by bad hygiene, and it cannot be spread to others. Who is more likely to get hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? HS usually starts after puberty, usually in the teens or twenties. It is more common in: Women People who are Black People with a family history of HS People who are overweight or have obesity People who smoke What are the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The symptoms of HS include: Small pitted areas of skin containing blackheads Painful, red, lumps that get bigger and break open. This causes abscesses that drain fluid and pus. They may itch and have an unpleasant odor. The abscesses heal very slowly, recur over time, and can lead to scarring and tunnels under the skin. HS can be mild, moderate, or severe: In mild HS, there are only one or a few lumps in one area of the skin. A mild case will often get worse, becoming a moderate disease. Moderate HS includes recurrences of the lumps that get bigger and break open. The lumps form in more than one area of the body. With severe HS, there are widespread lumps, scarring, and chronic pain that may make it hard to move.

{"chunk_id": "34_1", "topic_id": "34", "topic_title": "High Blood Pressure", "content": "What is blood pressure? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis. Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 Elevated 120 - 129 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure Stage 1 130 - 139 or 80 - 89 High Blood Pressure Stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away) Higher than 180 and Higher than 120 For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex. What are the different types of high blood pressure? There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.: Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it. Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure? When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack , stroke , heart failure , and kidney failure . What are the treatments for high blood pressure? Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines . You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type. If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in the body. The liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. The body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if your child or teen has high cholesterol (too much cholesterol in the blood), it can stick to the walls of their arteries and narrow or even block the arteries. This can put your child or teen at risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . What causes high cholesterol in children and teens? Three main factors contribute to high cholesterol in children and teens: An unhealthy diet, especially one that is high in saturated fats A family history of high cholesterol, especially when one or both parents have high cholesterol Having obesity Some diseases, such as diabetes , kidney disease , and certain thyroid diseases , can also cause high cholesterol in children and teens. What are the symptoms of high cholesterol in children and teens? There are usually no signs or symptoms that your child or teen has high cholesterol. How do I know if my child or teen has high cholesterol? There is a blood test to measure cholesterol levels. The test gives information about: Total cholesterol . This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL is often called \"bad\" cholesterol because it is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL is often called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Non-HDL. This number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides . This is another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease. For anyone aged 19 or younger, the healthy levels of cholesterol are Type of Cholesterol Healthy Level Total Cholesterol Less than 170 mg/dL Non-HDL Less than 120 mg/dL LDL Less than 110 mg/dL HDL More than 45 mg/dL When and how often your child or teen should get this test depends on their age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack , or stroke What are the treatments for high cholesterol in children and teens? Lifestyle changes are the main treatment for high cholesterol in children and teens. These changes include: Being more active. This includes getting regular physical activity and spending less time sitting (in front of a television, at a computer, on a phone or tablet, etc.). Healthy eating. A diet to lower cholesterol includes limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol. It is also important to eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Losing weight, if your child or teen is overweight or has obesity. If everyone in the family makes these changes, it will be easier for your child or teen to stick to them. It is also an opportunity to improve your health, and the health of the rest of your family. Sometimes these lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your child or teen's cholesterol. Their health care provider may consider giving your child or teen cholesterol medicines if they: Are at least 10 years old. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 190 mg/dL, even after six months of diet and exercise changes. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 160 mg/dL AND are at high risk for heart disease. Have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

This fungus is common in the central and eastern United States, especially around the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It can also be found in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It lives in the environment, especially in soil that contains large amounts of bat or bird droppings (poop). How do you get histoplasmosis? You get histoplasmosis by breathing in Histoplasma fungal spores from the air. It usually happens after you have been doing an activity that disturbs the soil, such as farming, construction, and landscaping. Histoplasmosis is not contagious. This means that you cannot get the infection from another person or an animal. What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis? Most people who breathe in the spores never have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start between 3 and 17 days after you breathe in the spores. The symptoms may include: Fever Cough Fatigue Chills Headache Chest pain Body aches For most people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away within a few weeks to a month. However, some people can have symptoms that last longer, especially if their infection becomes severe. Certain people are more likely to get a severe infection: People who have weakened immune systems , for example from: Having HIV Having had an organ transplant Taking medicines which weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy and steroids Infants Adults age 55 and over Severe histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection. It can also spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This is known as disseminated histoplasmosis. How is histoplasmosis diagnosed? To find out if you have histoplasmosis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and your medical and travel history Will do a physical exam Will likely order a blood, urine, or tissue test to look for signs of the fungus May order a chest x-ray or CT scan of the lungs What are the treatments for histoplasmosis? For some people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away without treatment. But you will need treatment if you have severe histoplasmosis in the lungs, chronic histoplasmosis, or an infection that has spread to other parts of the body.

{"chunk_id": "1_1", "topic_id": "1", "topic_title": "HIV", "content": "What is HIV? HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases. What is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. How does HIV spread? HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen: By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. \"Unprotected\" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy . From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it: People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men. Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities. People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV. What are the symptoms of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms: Fever Chills Rash Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Muscle aches Sore throat Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Mouth ulcers These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection. If the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested. How do I know if I have HIV? A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites. What are the treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others. Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life . Can HIV infection be prevented? You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by: Getting tested for HIV. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Getting tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Not injecting drugs. Talking to your provider about medicines to prevent HIV : PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV.

If you are pregnant and have HIV, there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways: During pregnancy During childbirth, especially if it is vaginal childbirth During breastfeeding But having HIV doesn't mean that you can't have children. Treatment with a combination of HIV medicines can help prevent passing HIV to your baby and protect your own health. If I have HIV, how can I prevent giving it to my baby? There are several different steps you can take to help prevent passing HIV to your baby: Taking HIV medicines . HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a very low level. The goal is to get your viral load so low that a standard lab test can't detect it. This is called having an \"undetectable viral load.\" Having an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy and prevent your baby from getting HIV. These medicines will also help protect your health. Most HIV medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. They don't usually raise the risk of birth defects . But it is important to talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the different medicines. Together you can decide which medicines are right for you. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly. If needed, having a cesarean delivery . If your viral load is not reduced enough by the medicines, having a cesarean delivery (C-Section) can help prevent passing HIV to your baby. Giving HIV medicines to the baby. Your baby will get HIV medicines as soon as possible after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Which medicine your baby gets depends on several factors, including what your viral load was just before you gave birth. Your baby will need to take medicines for 4 to 6 weeks. He or she will get several HIV tests over the first few months. Not breastfeeding. Breast milk can have HIV in it. In the United States, infant formula is safe and readily available. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that if you have HIV, you should feed your baby formula instead of breastfeeding.

It involves taking a combination of medicines every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. The medicines do not cure HIV infection, but help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others. How do HIV medicines work? HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV (viral load) in your body, which helps by: Giving your immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in your body, your immune system should be strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. Reducing the risk that you will spread HIV to others. What are the types of HIV medicines? There are many different types (called classes) of HIV medicines. Some work by blocking or changing enzymes that HIV needs to make copies of itself. This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several types of medicines do this: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to and later change reverse transcriptase Integrase inhibitors , also called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), block an enzyme called integrase Protease inhibitors (PIs) block an enzyme called protease Some types of HIV medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells: Fusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the cells CCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors block different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell. Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration. There are also multidrug combinations , which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines. When do I need to start taking HIV medicines? It's important to start taking HIV medicines as soon as possible after your diagnosis, especially if you: Are pregnant Have AIDS Have certain HIV-related illnesses and infections Have an early HIV infection (the first 6 months after infection with HIV) What else do I need to know about taking HIV medicines? You and your health care provider will work together to come up with a personal treatment plan. This plan will be based on many factors, including: The possible side effects of HIV medicines Potential drug interactions with any other medicines you take How many medicines you will need to take every day Any other health problems you may have It's important to take your medicines every day, according to the instructions from your provider. If you miss doses or don't follow a regular schedule, your treatment may not work, and the HIV virus may become resistant to the medicines. HIV medicines can cause side effects. Most of these side effects are manageable, but a few can be serious. Tell your provider about any side effects that you are having. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking to your provider. There may be steps you can take to help manage the side effects.

It can improve your overall health and fitness and reduce your risk for many chronic diseases. To get the most benefit, here's how much physical activity you should get: For adults Get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity each week. Or you could do a combination of the two: Try to spread your physical activity out over several days of the week. That's better than trying to do it all in one or two days. Some days you may not have long blocks of time to do physical activity. You can start slowly and break your exercise time into chunks. Even small amounts of exercise can be helpful. Aerobic activities include walking fast, jogging, swimming, and biking. Moderate intensity means that while you are doing that activity you should be able to say a few words in a row but not sing. Vigorous intensity means that while you are doing that activity, you won't be able to say more than a few words without stopping for a breath. Also, do strengthening activities two or more days per week: Strengthening activities include lifting weights, working with exercise bands, and doing sit-ups and pushups. Choose activities that work all parts of your body your legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms. For each exercise, try repeating the movement 8 to 12 times. As you get stronger, work up to doing 2 or 3 rounds of each exercise for the best results. If you are an older adult , you may also benefit from a combination of activities that include aerobic exercises, strength or resistance training, and balance training. Balance training such as walking heel-to-toe or standing on one leg may help improve stability and prevent falls. Before you start exercising, check with your health care provider to determine the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health. For preschool-aged children (ages 3-5) Preschool children should be physically active throughout the day, to help with their growth and development: They should get both structured and unstructured active play. Structured play has a goal and is directed by an adult. Examples include playing a sport or a game. Unstructured play is creative free play, such as playing on a playground. Encourage active play with a variety of activities. For children and teens Get 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most of it should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity: Activities should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development Moderate-intensity aerobic activities include walking, running, skipping, playing on the playground, playing basketball, and biking As part of the 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity, try to do each of these at least 3 days a week: vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, and bone-strengthening activity: Vigorous-intensity aerobic activities include running, jumping jacks, and fast swimming Muscle-strengthening activities include playing on playground equipment, playing tug-of-war, and doing pushups and pull-ups Bone-strengthening activities include hopping, skipping, jumping jacks, playing volleyball, and working with resistance bands Older adults, pregnant women, and people with chronic health problems Older adults, pregnant women , and people who have disabilities or special health needs should check with their provider on how much physical activity they should get and what types of activities they should do.

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. There are steps that you can take to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol. By keeping your cholesterol levels in range , you can lower your risk of heart diseases . What are the main treatments for high cholesterol? The main treatments for high cholesterol are lifestyle changes and medicines. Lifestyle changes to lower cholesterol Heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can help you lower or control your cholesterol include: Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It recommends that you eat and drink only enough calories to stay at a healthy weight and avoid weight gain. It also encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan . Aiming for a healthy weight . If you are overweight or have obesity , losing weight can help lower your LDL cholesterol and raise your HDL cholesterol. This is especially important for people with metabolic syndrome . Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that together raise your risk of heart diseases and other health problems. Getting regular physical activity . Studies have shown that physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol. Before you start an exercise program, ask your health care provider what level of physical activity is right for you. Managing stress . Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. Quitting smoking . Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol. Getting enough good-quality sleep . Getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night lowers your risk of high LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels. Medicines to lower cholesterol For some people, making lifestyle changes alone does not their lower cholesterol enough. They may also need to take cholesterol medicines . There are several types. They work in different ways and can have different side effects . If your provider recommends that you take cholesterol medicines, ask them which medicine would be right for you. Even if you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still need to continue with lifestyle changes. What are some other possible treatments for high cholesterol? Some other possible treatments for high cholesterol may include: Lipoprotein apheresis to lower cholesterol Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Some people who have FH may get a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood. Then the machine returns the rest of your blood back to your body. Supplements to lower cholesterol Many companies sell supplements that they say can lower cholesterol. For many of these supplements, there isn't enough evidence to show that they can lower cholesterol levels. But for some supplements, research has found that they have cholesterol-lowering effects. For example: Plant stanols and sterols supplements, when taken with meals, can reduce cholesterol levels. Some soy products have a small cholesterol-lowering effect. But research has found that eating soy foods gives you more of a benefit than taking supplements. Whole flaxseed and flaxseed lignans may help to lower cholesterol levels. However, flaxseed oil does not. Garlic supplements may lower cholesterol levels, but the effect is small when compared to the effects of cholesterol medicines.

Usually, your immune system controls HPV infections, and they go away on their own and don't cause any health problems, but some need treatment. There are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. They are called low-risk HPV and high-risk HPV. Sometimes high-risk HPV infections can stay at the cervix (the lower part of a woman's uterus) for many years. This can lead to cell changes. If these changes are not screened for and treated, they may get worse over time and become cancer. Low-risk HPVM can cause warts on or around your genitals , anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers: Cervical cancer Anal cancer Oropharyngeal cancer, a type of head and neck cancer, also called throat cancer Vulvar cancer Vaginal cancer Penile cancer Who is at risk for HPV infections? HPV infections are very common. Nearly all sexually active people are infected with HPV soon after they become sexually active. What are the symptoms of HPV infections? Some people get warts from certain low-risk HPV infections, but the other types (including the high-risk types) have no symptoms. If a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years and causes cell changes, you may have symptoms. You may also have symptoms if those cell changes develop into cancer. Which symptoms you have depends on which part of your body is affected. How are HPV infections diagnosed? Health care providers can usually find out if you have warts by looking at them. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with a high-risk type of HPV. Screening can prevent cancer by finding out if you need treatment for changes that might happen before cancer, called precancer. Screening tests for HPV can include: For women, there are cervical cancer screening tests that can find changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. As part of the screening, women may have Pap tests (sometimes called a Pap smear), HPV tests , or both. HPV tests use a sample of cervical cells. Your provider may also suggest a colposcopy to check for abnormal cells. What are the treatments for HPV infections? An HPV infection itself cannot be treated. Because HPV causes cancer at other places in the body, testing for the HPV virus can be helpful to make other treatment decisions. HPV infection. Talk to your provider about whether you need other tests and how often you should be checked to prevent cervical cancer. Warts. There are medicines that you can apply to a wart. If they don't work, your provider could freeze, burn, or surgically remove them. Cell changes caused by infection with high-risk HPV. Treatments may include medicines you apply to the affected area or various surgical procedures. People who have HPV-related cancers usually get the same types of treatment as people who have cancers that HPV does not cause. An exception to this is for people who have certain oral and throat cancers. They may have different treatment options. Can HPV infections be prevented? Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV, including genital warts and some that can cause cancer. The vaccines provide the most protection when people get them before exposure to the virus. This means that it is best for people to get them before they become sexually active. Ask your child's provider about when to vaccinate your child against HPV.

When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. For people with diabetes , your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. What is hyperglycemia? Hyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. What causes hyperglycemia? A key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity . You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick. Less commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands , certain medicines, and severe illnesses. What are the symptoms of hyperglycemia? The symptoms of hyperglycemia include: Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision If you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines. If you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it. What other problems can hyperglycemia cause? If hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications). If your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening. The symptoms of DKA may include: Trouble breathing Nausea or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Confusion Feeling very tired or sleepy If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help. How is hyperglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high. What are the treatments for hyperglycemia? If you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines. If you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin. Can hyperglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia.

For people with diabetes , your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. What is hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you: For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you. For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL. What causes hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines . It can happen: As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level. If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body. If you get a lot more physical activity than usual. If you drink too much alcohol without enough food. When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down. Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease , kidney disease , and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery . Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics , can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it. What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia? The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include: Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger How is hypoglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low. If you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause. What are the treatments for hypoglycemia? If you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency. If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan , physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines. If you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen. Can hypoglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you: Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low. Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity.

Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism has several causes. They include: Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid Congenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid Radiation treatment of the thyroid Certain medicines In rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet Who is at risk for hypothyroidism? You are at higher risk for hypothyroidism if you: Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have had a thyroid problem before, such as a goiter Have had surgery to correct a thyroid problem Have received radiation treatment to the thyroid, neck, or chest Have a family history of thyroid disease Were pregnant or had a baby in the past 6 months Have Turner syndrome , a genetic disorder that affects females Have pernicious anemia , in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have Sjogren's syndrome , a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth Have type 1 diabetes Have rheumatoid arthritis , an autoimmune disease that affects the joints Have lupus , a chronic autoimmune disease What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism? The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: Fatigue Weight gain A puffy face Trouble tolerating cold Joint and muscle pain Constipation Dry skin Dry, thinning hair Decreased sweating Heavy or irregular menstrual periods Fertility problems in women Depression Slowed heart rate Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Because hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years. What other problems can hypothyroidism cause? Hypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol . In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening. During pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications , such as premature birth , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage . It can also slow the baby's growth and development . How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about your symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hypothyroidism? The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year. If you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism. You should never stop taking your medicine without talking with your health care provider first. If you have Hashimoto's disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine.

{"chunk_id": "292_1", "topic_id": "292", "topic_title": "Hysterectomy", "content": "What is a hysterectomy? A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the uterus (womb). The uterus is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy. A hysterectomy treats problems like heavy bleeding, pain, or cancer in the uterus. After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods and can't become pregnant. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have both ovaries taken out, menopause symptoms will usually begin. What conditions does a hysterectomy treat? Hysterectomy is a major surgery. Your health care provider may suggest other treatment options first. These might include medicine, hormone therapy, or procedures to remove fibroids or stop heavy bleeding. Sometimes these won't help, or surgery might be the only option, depending on the condition that needs to be treated. Your provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you have: Fibroids , if you are near or past menopause, have large fibroids or very heavy bleeding. Endometriosis , that hasn't been cured by medicine or surgery. Uterine prolapse , which can happen after several vaginal births, menopause, or because of obesity. It is when the uterus drops into the vagina. Cancer , of the uterus , cervix , ovaries , or endometrium (the lining of the uterus). Vaginal bleeding , that is heavy or unusual and persists despite treatment. Chronic pelvic pain , which starts in the uterus. A hysterectomy is a last resort since it doesn't fix some pelvic pain. Adenomyosis , is a thickening of the walls of the uterus. A hysterectomy is only considered if pain is severe and no other treatments have worked. What are the different types of hysterectomies? Your provider will discuss the type of hysterectomy you need, depending on your condition. The different types of surgeries include: A total hysterectomy is the most common type and involves the removal of all the uterus, including the cervix. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. A partial (subtotal or supracervical) hysterectomy removes just the upper part of the uterus. The cervix is left in place, and your ovaries may or may not be removed A radical hysterectomy removes all the uterus, cervix, and tissue on both sides of the cervix and the upper part of the vagina. This is most often used to treat certain types of cancer, such as cervical cancer. The fallopian tubes and ovaries may or may not be removed. What methods are used for a hysterectomy? A hysterectomy may be done several different ways. Your provider will determine the best method for the surgery based on your general health, the reason for the surgery, and other factors. Methods to perform a hysterectomy include: Abdominal hysterectomy. A cut is made in your lower abdomen (belly). Your provider may recommend this method if you have a large uterus or to check other pelvic organs for signs of disease. This surgery has a longer recovery time than the others. Vaginal hysterectomy. A small cut is made in your vagina. This may not be an option if you have very large fibroids. Laparoscopic hysterectomy. Uses an instrument with a thin, lighted tube and an attached camera. This helps your provider see your pelvic organs. Small cuts are made in either your abdomen (belly) or vagina. This is not an option for all types of uterine fibroids. Robotic surgery. Your provider guides a robotic arm to do the surgery through small cuts in your lower abdomen (belly). After a hysterectomy , it can take four to six weeks to recover, depending on the type of surgery you have. What are the risks of a hysterectomy? Like all surgeries, a hysterectomy has risks, even though the results are usually good. Talk to your provider about the benefits and risks of having a hysterectomy.

{"chunk_id": "295_1", "topic_id": "295", "topic_title": "Immune System and Disorders", "content": "What is the immune system? Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases. When germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs. What are the parts of the immune system? The immune system has many different parts, including: Your skin, which can help prevent germs from getting into the body Mucous membranes, which are the moist, inner linings of some organs and body cavities. They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs. White blood cells, which fight germs Organs and tissues of the lymph system , such as the thymus, spleen , tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow . They produce, store, and carry white blood cells. How does the immune system work? Your immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn . When your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen. Afterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. What are the types of immunity? There are three different types of immunity: Innate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances. Active immunity , also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life. Passive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months. What can go wrong with the immune system? Sometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies , asthma , and autoimmune diseases . If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Other immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders . There are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems.

This includes kissing, touching, sneezing, coughing, and sexual contact. If you are pregnant , you can pass some germs to your fetus. Through indirect contact, when you touch something that has germs on it. For example, you could get germs if someone who is sick touched a door handle, and then you touch it. Through insect or animal bites. Through contaminated food , water, soil, or plants. What are the symptoms of infectious diseases? Infectious diseases can cause many different symptoms. Some are so mild that you may not even notice any symptoms, while others can be life-threatening. What are the treatments for infectious diseases? There are treatments for some infectious diseases, such as antibiotic , antiviral, antifungal and anti-parasitic medicines. But for other infections, such as some caused by viruses, you can only treat your symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the germ. Can infectious diseases be prevented? You can take steps to help prevent many infectious diseases: Get vaccinated . Wash your hands often . Pay attention to food safety . Avoid contact with wild animals. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Don't share items such as toothbrushes, combs, and straws.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 442, "char_count": 2652, "synonyms": ["Communicable diseases"], "mesh_terms": ["Communicable Diseases"], "search_terms": ["infectious diseases", "communicable diseases"], "quality_score": 70.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousdiseases.html"},
{"chunk_id": "298_1", "topic_id": "298", "topic_title": "Infectious Mononucleosis", "content": "What is infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is a disease caused by viruses .The most common cause is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mono is contagious, which means it can spread from person to person. It is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students. What causes infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Mono can be caused by many different viruses. But it is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found all over the world. Most people get an EBV infection at some point in their lives, but only some of them will get the symptoms of mono. EBV infections often happen during childhood or when someone is a young adult. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms. And when they do, it's hard to tell the difference between the symptoms of mono and the symptoms of other common childhood illnesses such as the flu . Teens and young adults who get EBV are more likely to have symptoms that are typical of mono. EBV and the other viruses that cause mono are usually spread through body fluids, especially saliva (spit). This means that you can get it through kissing. That's why mono is sometimes called \"the kissing disease.\" But you can also get these viruses if you share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with someone who has mono. Other less common ways of getting an infection are through blood transfusions , organ transplants , and blood and semen during sexual contact. What are the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (mono)? The symptoms of mono usually start four to six weeks after you get the infection. But they may start sooner in young children. The symptoms often develop slowly, and they may not all happen at the same time. They can include: Extreme fatigue Fever Sore throat Head and body aches Swollen lymph glands in your neck and armpits Rash Swollen liver, spleen, or both (these are less common symptoms) Most people get better in two to four weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last for six months or longer. How is infectious mononucleosis (mono) diagnosed? Your healthcare provider may diagnose mono based on your symptoms and a physical exam. The exam will include checking to see if your lymph nodes, tonsils, liver, or spleen are swollen. In some cases, your provider might also order a mono test to confirm the diagnosis. What are the treatments for infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . Getting lots of rest. Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome . This syndrome is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver. If you have severe symptoms, your provider may suggest additional treatment based on which organs in your body are affected by the mono. Antibiotics don't treat viral infections, so they do not help with mono. Some people do get bacterial infections such as strep throat along with mono. In that case, you probably need antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection. But you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Those antibiotics can cause a rash in people who have mono. Mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which could rupture and cause a medical emergency. To try to protect the spleen, providers recommend avoiding intense exercise and contact sports until you fully recover (about a month). Can infectious mononucleosis (mono) be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against mono. To lower your chance of getting or spreading mono: Don't share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with anyone, especially if you or the other person has mono. Don't kiss someone if you or the other person has mono. Wash your hands often with soap and water.

There are other substances that people might inhale, such as alcohol. But those are not called inhalants, because they can also be used another way. Inhalants are the substances that you can misuse only by inhaling them. Using inhalants to try to get high, even once, can be very harmful to your brain and body. It can even lead to death. What are the types of inhalants? Inhalants are often products that are easily bought and can be found in the home or workplace. They contain dangerous substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when they are inhaled. The four main types of inhalants are: Solvents , which are liquids that become gas at room temperature. They include paint thinner, nail polish remover, gasoline, and glue. Aerosol sprays , such as spray paint, deodorant spray, and vegetable oil sprays. Gases , including gas from lighters, whipped cream dispensers, and laughing gas. Nitrites, which are similar to a prescription medicine for chest pain. They are sometimes called \"poppers.\" They are sold in small bottles and may be labeled as \"air freshener,\" \"leather cleaner,\" or \"liquid aroma.\" They are usually not used to alter someone's mood, but to improve their sexual function. Some of the common slang terms for various inhalants include: Gluey Huff Laughing gas Rush Snappers Whippets/Whippits How do people use inhalants? People who use inhalants breathe in the fumes through their nose or mouth, usually by \"sniffing,\" \"snorting,\" \"bagging,\" or \"huffing.\" It's called different names depending on the substance and equipment used. The high that inhalants produce usually lasts just a few minutes, so people often try to make it last by inhaling them again and again over several hours. Who uses inhalants? Inhalants are mostly used by young kids and teens. They often try inhalants before they try other substances because inhalants are easier to get. What are the signs that someone is using inhalants? Signs that someone is using inhalants include: Chemical odors on breath or clothing Paint or other stains on face, hands, or clothes Hidden empty spray paint or solvent containers and chemical-soaked rags or clothing Red or runny eyes or nose Drunk or disoriented appearance Slurred speech Nausea or loss of appetite Inattentiveness, lack of coordination, irritability, and depression What are the health effects of using inhalants? Most inhalants affect your central nervous system and slow down brain activity. Inhalants can cause both short-term and long-term health effects: Short-term health effects include: Slurred or distorted speech Lack of body control Euphoria (feeling \"high\") Dizziness Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real) Long-term health effects may include: Liver and kidney damage Loss of coordination Spasms in your arms and legs Delayed behavioral development Brain damage Using inhalants, even once, could lead to an overdose. This can cause you to have seizures or your heart to stop. It can also be deadly. Are inhalants addictive? Addiction to inhalants is rare, but it can happen if you use them repeatedly. Stopping them can cause withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea , sweating , trouble sleeping , and mood changes. Behavioral therapy may help people who are addicted to inhalants. Can inhalant misuse be prevented? Kids and teens who use inhalants to get high are more likely to try other drugs and to have a substance use disorder (SUD) later in life. So it's important to try to prevent inhalant abuse. One thing that parents can do is talk to their children about inhalants. They can explain the dangers and give their children tips on how to deal with peer pressure if someone asks them to try inhalants.

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones . How do you get iron? Iron is found naturally in many foods and is added to some fortified food products. Foods that are high in iron include: Lean meat, seafood, and poultry Iron-fortified breakfast cereals and breads White beans, lentils, spinach, kidney beans, and peas Nuts and some dried fruits, such as raisins Iron is available in supplements, either on its own or as part of many multivitamin/mineral supplements. What causes low iron? Most people in the United States get enough iron. The amount that you need each day depends on your age, your sex, and whether you consume a mostly plant-based diet. Sometimes people can have trouble getting enough iron. There can be many causes, including blood loss, a poor diet, or a problem absorbing enough iron from foods. Those who are more likely to have low iron include people who: Have heavy periods Are pregnant or breastfeeding Are infants (especially if they were born premature or low birth weight ) Are frequent blood donors Have cancer , certain digestive diseases , or heart failure Are on kidney dialysis Have trouble absorbing iron because they: Have a digestive condition such as celiac disease , ulcerative colitis , Crohn's disease , or Helicobacter pylori infection Had weight loss surgery What happens if you don't get enough iron? If you have too little iron, you may develop iron-deficiency anemia .

What are the symptoms of ischemic stroke? Symptoms of stroke often happen suddenly. They include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause If you think someone is having a stroke, the F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for. Think \"FAST\" and look for: F ace drooping on one side when smiling. A rm weakness that occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward. S peech is slurred or strange. T ime to call 911. How is an ischemic stroke diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider may do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms and medical history, and use imaging tests . Other heart tests may be done to help find the cause of the stroke. How is an ischemic stroke treated? It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. The most common treatments include: Medicines such as blood thinners or thrombolytics (which break up and dissolve existing clots) may be used to prevent or treat ischemic stroke. Surgery or stenting may be used to open narrowed arteries or remove plaque build-up from the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. After treatment, rehabilitation can help you regain lost skills and independence. Your provider may also order other medicines to manage your blood pressure , cholesterol , or other health problems such as diabetes that may increase your risk for stroke. Can an ischemic stroke be prevented? The best way to prevent stroke is by making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your risk. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your provider may prescribe medicine to help manage your risk factors.

{"chunk_id": "4621_1", "topic_id": "4621", "topic_title": "Joint Disorders", "content": "What are joints? Your joints are places where two or more bones come together. Your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and knuckles are all joints. Your spine has joints, too. But joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move. What are joint disorders? Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury . What diseases can affect the joints? Many diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include: Arthritis . Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life. Lupus . This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis. Sjögren's Syndrome . This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too. Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms. What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries? Joint disorders from sudden injuries include: Sprains and strains . Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object. Dislocated joints . A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency. Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you: Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbness Can't put weight on the joint Have pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another way What types of joint disorders happen from overuse? Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting. Joint overuse injuries include: Bursitis . The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis. Tendinitis . This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move. Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements. The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery. How can I keep my joints healthy? Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better. When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads.

It causes joint inflammation (swelling), pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. It can affect any joint, but it is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. JA can affect your child's growth and development, and in some cases, it can also affect other organs. Finding JA early and starting treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce joint damage. Who is more likely to get juvenile arthritis? There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children. The most common type of JA in children under age 16 is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). There are multiple types of JIA. Symptoms and the number of joints affected help determine the type. Some types of JIA are more common in girls. What causes juvenile arthritis? The exact cause of JA is unknown. Most types are autoimmune disorders . This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's tissues. What are the symptoms of juvenile arthritis? Symptoms can vary depending on the type of JA. The symptoms of most types include joint pain, swelling, warmth, and stiffness. Your child may not complain of pain or stiffness, but one early sign of JA may be limping or clumsiness in the morning or after resting. Larger joints, such as the knee, may be swollen. Certain types of JA can cause a high fever , swollen lymph nodes, a rash, growth problems, or eye inflammation in some children. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. How is juvenile arthritis diagnosed? There is no single test for JA, so it can be hard to diagnose.

They are made of cancer cells, new blood vessels, and blood cells. The lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. This makes Kaposi sarcoma different from other cancers. What causes Kaposi sarcoma and who is more likely to develop it? Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Most people infected with this virus don't get Kaposi sarcoma. But certain people who get this virus are more likely to develop one of the types of Kaposi sarcoma: People with weakened immune systems due to HIV can develop epidemic (HIV-associated) Kaposi sarcoma. People with weakened immune systems due to medicines they need to take after an organ transplant can develop iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi sarcoma. Older men of Mediterranean or Eastern European Jewish heritage can develop classic Kaposi sarcoma. Young men in Africa can develop endemic (African) Kaposi sarcoma. What are the symptoms of Kaposi sarcoma? Kaposi sarcoma usually starts out as one or more red, purple, or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet. They are most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. Over time, lesions may form in other parts of the body. The lesions may not cause symptoms. But sometimes the lesions can cause problems, especially as you get more of them and they grow bigger. For example: Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling If lesions grow in your stomach or intestines, they can bleed and may cause abdominal (belly) pain and diarrhea Lesions in the lungs can also bleed and may cause shortness of breath How is Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed? To find out whether you have Kaposi sarcoma, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical and family history Will do a physical exam May order a chest x-ray to look for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs May do a biopsy to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin May do an endoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the stomach and intestines May do a bronchoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs If you do have Kaposi sarcoma, you will likely need blood and imaging tests to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Other names for the disease are Kawasaki syndrome and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a type of vasculitis , which is inflammation of the blood vessels. Kawasaki disease is serious, but most children can fully recover if they are treated right away. What causes Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease happens when the immune system injures the blood vessels by mistake. Researchers do not fully know why this happens. But when it does, the blood vessels become inflamed and can narrow or close off. Genetics may play a role in Kawasaki disease. There may also be environmental factors, such as infections. It does not seem to be contagious. This means that it cannot be passed from one child to another. Who is more likely to develop Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease usually affects children under the age of 5. But older children and adults can sometimes get it. It is more common in boys than girls. It can affect children of any race, but those with Asian or Pacific Islander descent are more likely to get it. What are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease? The symptoms of Kawasaki disease may include: High fever lasting at least five days A rash , often on the back, chest, and groin Swollen hands and feet Redness of the lips, lining of the mouth, tongue, palms of the hand, and soles of the feet Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Contact your child's health care provider if your child has a fever for 4 days, especially if they have any other symptoms of Kawasaki disease. What other problems can Kawasaki disease cause? Sometimes Kawasaki disease can affect the walls of the coronary arteries. These arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart. This can lead to: An aneurysm (bulging and thinning of the walls of the arteries). This can raise the risk of blood clots in the arteries. If the blood clots are not treated, they could lead to a heart attack or internal bleeding. Inflammation in the heart. Heart valve problems . Kawasaki disease can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain and nervous system, the immune system, and the digestive system. How is Kawasaki disease diagnosed? There is no specific test for Kawasaki disease. To find out if your child has Kawasaki disease, your child's provider: Will do a physical exam, which includes looking at the signs and symptoms Will likely order blood and urine tests to rule out other diseases and check for signs of inflammation May order tests to check for damage to the heart, such as an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (EKG) What are the treatments for Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease is usually treated in the hospital with an intravenous (IV) dose of immunoglobulin (IVIG) antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight infections. Aspirin may also be part of the treatment. But do not give your child aspirin unless the health care provider tells you to. Aspirin can cause Reye syndrome in children.

This error causes a male to be born with an extra X chromosome. Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell, two of which are the sex chromosomes. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), and males usually have one X and one Y (XY). In KS, the male usually has two X chromosomes and one Y (XXY). In rare cases, a male could have XY in some cells and XXY in other cells. This is called mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. Males with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome may have fewer symptoms, depending on the number of XY cells they have in their bodies and where those cells are located. What are the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? Some males with KS may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. So they might not know that they have KS, or they might not get diagnosed with it right away. In other cases, the symptoms can be more severe. Boys with KS may be taller than other boys their age, with more fat around the belly. After puberty, they may have: Smaller testes and penis Breast growth (called gynecomastia) Less facial and body hair Reduced muscle tone Narrower shoulders and wider hips Weaker bones Decreased sexual interest Lower energy Many of these symptoms happen because of low testosterone in the body. Testosterone is the main male sex hormone . Boys with KS may also have learning or language problems. These problems may affect them socially, so they may be shy and quiet and can have trouble fitting in. Most males with KS are infertile because they make little or no sperm. How is Klinefelter syndrome (KS) diagnosed? A genetic test called a karyotype test can diagnose KS. This test can show if there are abnormal chromosomes, including if there is an extra X chromosome. What are the treatments for Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? There is no cure for KS, but treatments are available. The sooner the treatment is started, the better. If treatment is started by early puberty, it will likely help in reducing the symptoms. Treatments for KS may include: Testosterone replacement therapy Surgery to remove or reduce breasts Physical, speech, behavioral, and occupational therapy In some cases, fertility treatments may help men with KS father children.

This can have a big impact on your life. The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis . The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away, causing pain and swelling. Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion.

{"chunk_id": "3924_1", "topic_id": "3924", "topic_title": "Knee Replacement", "content": "What is knee replacement surgery? Knee replacement surgery is a surgery to replace parts of your knee joint with new, artificial parts. You may need a knee replacement if you have knee damage that causes severe pain and difficulty doing daily activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. It is usually done when other treatments for knee pain haven't helped enough. The goal of a knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you move better. People of all ages may have knee replacement surgery. But it is more common in older people. The decision whether to have surgery is based on your overall health and how much your knee bothers you. What conditions does knee replacement surgery treat? Knee replacement surgery treats conditions that cause the cartilage of the knee joint to wear away. These include: Knee osteoarthritis . This is the most common reason for knee replacement surgery. It usually develops over time after an injury or with aging. Knee damage from other types of arthritis . Problems from knee joints that aren't formed correctly . What happens during knee replacement surgery? During the surgery, a surgeon removes damaged cartilage and some bone from the surfaces of your knee joint. Cartilage is tissue that covers your bones where they meet. Healthy cartilage is smooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage becomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain. After removing the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts to your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee new, smooth surfaces. Knee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of your knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). In a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces: The end of the shinbone The end of the thighbone The back of the kneecap What happens after knee replacement surgery? Some people go home the same day they have surgery. Other people will stay in the hospital a few days. To help prevent blood clots , you'll most likely take blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time after surgery. The success of your surgery depends a lot on what you do at home to help yourself recover. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to make your knee stronger and help it bend. It is important to do these exercises regularly. You may need to use a cane or walker for several weeks after the surgery. It will probably also be several weeks before you can drive. Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again. Most people who follow their recovery instructions can get back to nearly all of their normal daily activities within 3 to 6 weeks after surgery. What is life like after a knee replacement? After recovering from surgery, most people can move better with less pain than before surgery. But having an artificial knee is not the same as having a normal, healthy knee. You need to protect your new knee by: Staying at a healthy weight . Getting regular physical activity . Not doing any high-impact activities, such as jogging, running, and jumping. Instead, you can try low-impact activities that are good for your knee, such as walking, biking, and swimming What are the risks of knee replacement surgery? The chance of having problems after knee replacement surgery is low. But there are risks after any surgery. Possible problems after knee replacement surgery include: Infection Blood clots Heart attack Stroke Nerve damage Scarring that limits how far you can bend your knee Your age, general health, and how active you are can all affect your risk of having a problem after knee replacement surgery. How long does a knee replacement last? A knee replacement doesn't last forever. After 15 to 20 years, the artificial knee parts may become loose or worn. If that happens, you may need another surgery on the same knee. If you're thinking about having knee replacement surgery, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.

The sooner a learning disability is identified and addressed, the better a child is likely to perform in school. What causes learning disabilities? Learning disabilities don't have anything to do with how smart your child is. They are caused by differences in the brain, and they affect the way the brain takes in and uses information. These differences are usually present at birth. But there are certain factors that can play a role in the development of a learning disability, including: Genetics Environmental exposures, such as lead Using substances while pregnant How are learning disabilities diagnosed? The earlier you can find and treat a learning disability, the better. Unfortunately, learning disabilities are usually not found until a child is in school. If you notice that your child is struggling, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider about having your child evaluated for a learning disability. The evaluation may include: Doing a physical exam to check for a medical problem that might make learning more difficult. Asking about your family history. Test your child's intellectual and school performance. What are the treatments for learning disabilities? The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. A teacher or other learning specialist can help your child learn skills by building on their strengths and finding ways to make up for their weaknesses. They may suggest ways you can help your child when they do homework. Instructors may try special teaching methods, make changes to the classroom, or use technologies that can assist your child's learning needs.

Legionnaires' disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria . The disease got its name when a group of people at an American Legion convention became ill with this type of pneumonia. Legionella is found naturally in freshwater, such as lakes and rivers. It can also be found in soil. But people usually only get sick from it when if it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These systems can include hot tubs, fountains, and the plumbing systems of large buildings, such as hotels or nursing homes. Legionella can also cause Pontiac fever. This is a milder, flu-like illness that doesn't infect your lungs. What causes Legionnaires' disease? You can get the infection by breathing in mist or small drops of water that contain the bacteria. The mist may come from hot tubs, showers, or large building air conditioning units. You usually can't get infected by drinking water that contains the bacteria unless you aspirate it (accidentally breathe the water into your lungs). The bacteria don't spread from person to person. Disease outbreaks happen when many people are exposed to the same water source that contains the bacteria. Who is more likely to develop Legionnaires' disease? Most healthy people who come in contact with the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to develop an infection if you: Are over the age of 50 Are a current or former smoker Have a chronic (long-lasting) disease such as diabetes or kidney failure Have a chronic lung disease such as COPD or emphysema Have a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV or cancer or are taking medicines that suppress your immune system Live in a long-term care facility Have recently stayed in a hospital or had surgery requiring anesthesia What are the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease? The symptoms usually show up 2 to 14 days after you were exposed to Legionella bacteria. Most of the symptoms are similar to those of other types of pneumonia. But Legionnaires' disease may also cause gastrointestinal symptoms and mental changes. The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease may include: Cough High fever Chills Headache Chest pain Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Confusion What other problems can Legionnaires' disease cause? Legionnaires' disease can cause life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure , kidney failure, and sepsis . About 1 out of every 10 people who get sick with Legionnaires' disease will die from complications of the illness. How is Legionnaires' disease diagnosed? To find out if you have Legionnaires' disease, your health care provider will probably order a chest x-ray to see if you have pneumonia. If you do have it, lab tests such as a urine or sputum test can check for the Legionella bacteria. Your provider may also order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to the bacteria. What are the treatments for Legionnaires' disease? If you have Legionnaires' disease, you will likely need care in a hospital. The treatment is with antibiotics . Most people will recover, especially if they were healthy when they got the disease. Getting treatment early can increase the chances of getting better. Can Legionnaires' disease be prevented? You can lower your risk of getting Legionnaires' disease if you: Clean all your water-related devices regularly. This could include portable humidifiers, water heaters, air conditioners, and nasal rinses. If you haven't used your faucets and showerheads for a week or more, flush them by letting the hot and cold faucets run for at least two minutes before use.

Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work. What are the types of leukemia? There are different types of leukemia. Which type of leukemia you have depends on the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly. The type of blood cell could be: Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell Myeloid cells, immature cells that become white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets The different types can grow quickly or slowly: Acute leukemia is fast growing. It usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. Chronic leukemia is slow growing. It usually gets worse over a longer period of time. The main types of leukemia are: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) , which is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , which is more common in older adults but can also affect children Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , which is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) , which usually occurs in adults during or after middle age What causes leukemia? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Who is at risk for leukemia? For the specific types, there are different factors which can raise your risk of getting that type. Overall, your risk of leukemia goes up as you age. It is most common over age 60. What are the symptoms of leukemia? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chromic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first. How is leukemia diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests . There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes Once the provider makes a diagnosis, there may be additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What are the treatments for leukemia? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type you have, how severe the leukemia is, your age, your overall health, and other factors.

Types of malnutrition include: Protein-energy undernutrition , also called macronutrient undernutrition, happens when your body doesn't get enough protein or calories from food. Two serious forms of this are kwashiorkor and marasmus. An imbalanced nutritional status occurs when you are not getting the right mix of nutrients. You may get enough calories, but not enough vitamins or minerals. Vitamin deficiency diseases happen when your body doesn't get enough of certain vitamins. Without the right vitamins, your body cannot stay healthy and may develop specific diseases. For example, scurvy can develop from too little vitamin C , rickets from too little vitamin D , and anemia from too little iron or vitamin B12 . Failure to thrive occurs when children don't gain weight or grow as expected . This may be due to not getting enough food, trouble absorbing nutrients , or other health problems.

Health care providers use mammograms to look for early signs of breast cancer that can't be felt during a breast exam. There are two types of mammograms: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms. What is a screening mammogram? A screening mammogram is a mammogram usually done for women who have no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Regular screening mammograms can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 74. This is because they can find breast cancer early and treatment can start earlier, maybe before it has spread. But screening mammograms can also have risks. They can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation . You should talk to your provider about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram. What is a diagnostic mammogram? A diagnostic mammogram takes a little longer to do than a screening mammogram. It's done for people who have a lump or other signs or symptoms of breast cancer. The signs can include breast pain, thickening of the skin of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast size or shape. But these signs can also be caused by a breast condition that is benign (not cancer). A diagnostic mammogram may also be used if you have breast implants or if there are other reasons it's difficult to view your breast tissue. How is a mammogram done? When you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture. You will get both breasts x-rayed from the front and from the side. Afterwards, a radiologist (a doctor with special training) will read the mammogram. The doctor will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the clinic or medical office that you went to. If your results are not normal, you should hear back earlier. Ask your provider when and how you will receive your results. What happens if my mammogram is not normal? An abnormal (not normal) mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. You will need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before your provider can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon.

If you are addicted, you will have a strong need to take the drug. You may also need to smoke more and more of it to get the same high. When you try to quit, you may have mild withdrawal symptoms such as: Irritability Trouble sleeping Decreased appetite Anxiety Cravings What is medical marijuana? The marijuana plant has chemicals that can help with some health problems. More states are making it legal to use the plant as medicine for certain medical conditions. But there isn't enough research to show that the whole plant works to treat or cure these conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. Marijuana is still illegal at the national level. However, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. The two main cannabinoids that are of medical interest are THC and CBD. The FDA has approved two drugs that contain THC. These drugs treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from AIDS . There is also a liquid drug that contains CBD. It treats two forms of severe childhood epilepsy . Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.

It's usually done to treat breast cancer by removing the cancer. A mastectomy may be the first treatment option for some types of breast cancer or done after chemotherapy for other types. If you are at a very high risk for breast cancer, sometimes a mastectomy may be done to reduce your risk. What are the different types of mastectomies? There are different types of mastectomies. Each differs in the amount of breast tissue and lymph nodes that are removed. Some types of breast surgery remove the breast skin and the nipple. Others may also remove nearby lymph nodes, which are part of your immune system and help protect your body from infection and disease. Which surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer, the size of the tumor, the size of the breast, and whether the lymph nodes are involved. Types of breast surgery include: Total (simple) mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue and nipple of the breast that has cancer. Some lymph nodes under your arm may be removed and checked for cancer. Modified radical mastectomy is the removal of the breast that has cancer, including the nipple, areola (dark-colored skin around the nipple), skin over the breast, most of the lymph nodes under the arm, and often the lining over the chest muscles. Lumpectomy is breast-sparing surgery. The tumor and some normal breast tissue around it are removed, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under your arm may be removed and checked for cancer. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if cancer is near it. No matter which breast surgery you choose, you may also need other treatments. These could include radiation therapy , chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy. You may choose to have breast reconstruction to rebuild your breast at the same time as the mastectomy, or it may be done later.

Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors for heart disease , diabetes , and other health problems. You can have just one risk factor, but people often have several of them together. When you have at least three of them, it is called metabolic syndrome. These risk factors include: A large waistline, also called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Too much fat around the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than too much fat in other parts of the body. Having a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Having a low HDL cholesterol level . HDL is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Having high blood pressure . If your blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to other health problems. Having a high fasting blood sugar . Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes. The more factors you have, the higher your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke is. What causes metabolic syndrome? Metabolic syndrome has several causes that act together: Overweight and obesity An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels. Age - your risk goes up as get older Genetics - ethnicity and family history People who have metabolic syndrome often also have excessive blood clotting and inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it. Who is at risk for metabolic syndrome? The most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are: Abdominal obesity (a large waistline) An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance There are certain groups of people who have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome: Some racial and ethnic groups. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by White and Black people. People who have diabetes People who have a sibling or parent who has diabetes Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) People who take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels What are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome? Most of the metabolic risk factors have no obvious signs or symptoms, except for a large waistline. How is metabolic syndrome diagnosed? Your health care provider will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome: A large waistline , which means a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women 40 inches or more for men A high triglyceride level , which is 150 mg/dL or higher A low HDL cholesterol level , which is Less than 50 mg/dL for women Less than 40 mg/dL for men High blood pressure , which is a reading of 130/85 mmHg or higher. A high fasting blood sugar , which is 100 mg/dL or higher What are the treatments for metabolic syndrome? The most important treatment for metabolic syndrome is a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes: A heart-healthy eating plan, which limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking (or not starting if you don't already smoke) If making lifestyle changes is not enough, you may need to take medicines. For example, you may need medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure. Can metabolic syndrome be prevented? The best way to prevent metabolic syndrome is through the heart-healthy lifestyle changes.

Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant . What causes a miscarriage? A miscarriage can happen in any pregnancy. Most miscarriages occur because the fetus doesn't develop properly. This is often linked to a genetic problem with the fetus, such as an extra or missing chromosome. In many cases, the cause of a miscarriage is unknown. Some possible factors that may increase the chance of a miscarriage can include: Problems with the uterus or cervix Chronic diseases, including polycystic ovary syndrome Genetic problems with the fetus Pregnancy after 35 years of age Smoking, drug or alcohol use Certain chronic (long-term) health conditions, such as uncontrolled diabetes Severe malnutrition What are the signs of a miscarriage? The signs of a miscarriage may be different for everyone and can vary based on how far along you are in your pregnancy. Signs of a miscarriage can include: Vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain. Some women may have some spotting in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure, contact your provider right away if you have any bleeding. Dark-colored vaginal discharge. A gush of fluid or tissue from your vagina. Cramping or pain in your abdomen (belly) or lower back. Sometimes, it's hard to know what's normal during pregnancy. If something seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your provider. How is a miscarriage diagnosed? To check if you have had a miscarriage, your provider may do the following: A pelvic exam to check your cervix. Blood tests to check things such as the amount of blood loss and confirm pregnancy . An ultrasound to check the fetus. What is the treatment for a miscarriage? Treatment after a miscarriage often depends on when it occurs during the pregnancy. If you miscarry early in your pregnancy, you may not need any treatment. If you are 12 or more weeks pregnant, you may need a shot to prevent problems with the Rh factor in future pregnancies. In some cases, tissue is left in the uterus. If you don't have any signs of infection, your provider may recommend waiting for the tissue to pass naturally. If you need treatment to remove the tissue, it can include: Medicines A procedure called dilatation and curettage (D&C) or vacuum aspiration No matter when it occurs, losing a pregnancy can be difficult. Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you decide to try to get pregnant again, talk with your provider to understand any risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy pregnancies later. Can a miscarriage be prevented? Miscarriage can affect anyone and often can't be prevented.

{"chunk_id": "1605_1", "topic_id": "1605", "topic_title": "Mitral Valve Prolapse", "content": "What is the mitral valve? The mitral valve is one of the four valves in your heart. Heart valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats, they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. The mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards. What is mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) happens when the flaps of the mitral valve become floppy and don't close tightly. In some cases, blood may leak backwards through the valve to the chamber it came from. This is called backflow, or regurgitation. When there is a lot of mitral valve backflow, the heart can't push enough blood out to the body. But most people who have MVP don't have any backflow. In fact, MVP doesn't cause any health problems for most people who have it. Who is more likely to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Anyone can have MVP. Most people who have it were born with it. MVP tends to run in families, but researchers don't know the exact cause. You may be more likely to develop MVP if you: Are older. The risk of MVP increases as aging affects the valve. Had rheumatic fever, a disease that can develop after a strep throat infection and cause damage to the heart valves. Were born with a connective tissue disorder , such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome . Have Graves' disease , a type of thyroid condition. Have scoliosis (a side-to-side curve of the spine) or other problems with the bones of your body. Have some types of muscular dystrophy . Mitral valve prolapse with backflow is most common in men and people who have high blood pressure . What are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people who have MVP don't have any symptoms. But if it does cause symptoms, they may include: Heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is fluttering, skipping beats, or beating too hard or too fast) Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) A cough Fatigue , dizziness , or anxiety Migraines Chest pain What other problems can mitral valve prolapse (MVP) cause? In rare cases, MVP can cause other problems. They're most often caused by backflow. They can include: Arrhythmia , a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Endocarditis , an infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves Heart failure How is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) diagnosed? Health care providers often find MVP during routine health check-ups. If you have MVP, your provider may hear a clicking sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. If blood flows backwards through the valve, your heart may also make a whooshing sound called a heart murmur. You may also need certain heart tests . The most useful test is an echocardiogram, or echo. This is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to make a moving picture of your heart. What are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people don't need any treatment for MVP. If you have symptoms with little or no backflow, you may only need medicine to relieve your discomfort. If the amount of backflow is significant, you may need treatment to prevent other heart problems from developing. Treatments may include: Medicines to help your heart work better. Heart surgery to repair or replace a very abnormal mitral valve with backflow. The goal of surgery is to improve your symptoms and reduce your risk of developing heart failure. When possible, valve repair is generally preferred over replacement. That's because repairs are less likely to weaken the heart muscle, and they're less likely to cause heart infection. Can mitral valve prolapse be prevented? You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse. But if you have mitral valve prolapse, you can help prevent the rare but serious problems it can cause by: Brushing and flossing your teeth regularly . That helps keep bacteria out of your bloodstream, which further reduces the rare risk of a heart infection. Asking your provider if you need to take antibiotics before dental work or surgery to lower your risk of heart infection. This mostly applies to people who have had valve repair or replacement surgery. Getting regular check-ups and taking any medicines that your provider may have prescribed.

What are the types of muscular dystrophy (MD)? There are many different types of MD. Some of the more common types include: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most common childhood form. It is severe and affects boys more often than girls. The symptoms usually start between ages 3 and 6. Becker muscular dystrophy, which is similar to Duchenne but is less severe and gets worse more slowly. It often starts in the teenage years. Congenital muscular dystrophies, which are present at birth or before age 2. They can be mild or severe. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which often starts in the teenage years. At first, it affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. Each of the types of MD can be different in many ways, such as: Who is more likely to get them Which muscles they affect When they appear, such as in infancy, childhood, middle age, or later What the symptoms are How serious the symptoms are How quickly they get worse Whether they run in families Whether they affect other organs Even within the same type of MD, people can have different symptoms. What causes muscular dystrophy (MD)? MD is genetic, meaning that it caused by a change in one or more genes. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. The gene changes in MD affect proteins that strengthen and protect muscles. There are different gene changes that cause each type of MD. And sometimes people who have the same type of MD can have different gene changes. Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first in your family to have a muscular dystrophy. How is muscular dystrophy (MD) diagnosed? To find out if you or your child has MD, your health care provider may use: A medical and family history A physical exam Blood and urine tests, including genetic tests and tests for certain enzymes that may be released by damaged muscles Muscle biopsies Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals Heart testing , such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), since some types of MD can cause heart problems Exercise tests to measure muscle strength and breathing and detect any increased rates of certain chemicals following exercise Imaging tests such as an MRI to look at muscle quality and bulk and measure fatty replacement of muscle tissue What are the treatments for muscular dystrophy (MD)?

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). ME/CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed. What causes myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Researchers don't yet know what causes ME/CFS. There may be more than one potential cause. It is also possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness. Researchers are studying many possible causes, including: Infections Immune system changes Physical or emotional stress Changes in the way cells in the body get their energy Genetics; the illness can sometimes run in families Who is more likely to develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Anyone can get ME/CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women are more likely to develop it than adult men. What are the symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? The primary, or core, symptoms of ME/CFS are: Not being able to do activities that you used to do before the illness, along with severe fatigue. The fatigue must last six months or longer, and it is not improved by rest. Post-exertional malaise (PEM), which means that your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity. Sleep problems . Along with the primary symptoms, to be diagnosed with ME/CFS, you need to have one or both of these symptoms: Problems with thinking and memory . Worsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. It can cause you to feel lightheaded, dizzy , weak, or faint while standing or sitting up. Some of the other symptoms that ME/CFS can cause include: Pain , including muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches Sore throat Tender lymph nodes (glands) in the neck or armpits Digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome Chills and night sweats Allergies and sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light, or noise ME/CFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time; sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse. How is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnosed? ME/CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for ME/CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Your provider will do a thorough medical exam, which will include: Asking about your medical history and your family's medical history. Asking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Some questions they may ask could include how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life. Thorough physical and mental status exams. Blood, urine, or other tests to check for other illnesses which could be causing your symptoms. Your provider may also ask you to see a specialist to check for other conditions which can cause similar symptoms. What are the treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes you the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits . If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist. Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again. When you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to try to take care of yourself. So it's important that you have support from family members and friends. There are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as: Getting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life. Eating a healthy diet. Nutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them. Complementary therapies such as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy. Make sure to talk to your provider before you try any new treatments. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for ME/CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.

{"chunk_id": "336_1", "topic_id": "336", "topic_title": "Myasthenia Gravis", "content": "What is myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis, sometimes called MG, is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that causes weakness in your voluntary muscles. The voluntary muscles are the ones that you can control. They include the muscles you use for: Eye and eyelid movement Facial expressions Chewing Talking Swallowing Breathing Moving your arms and legs You can also have weakness in other muscles. This weakness gets worse with activity, and better with rest. Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases , your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. What causes myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis is caused by an error in how nerve signals are sent to muscles. These signals get blocked at the nerve-muscle junction. This junction is the place where the nerve endings connect with the muscles they control. Normally, this is how the signals work: The signals travel down a nerve that controls movement in the muscle The nerve endings release a substance called acetylcholine Acetylcholine binds to the muscle tissue at the nerve-muscle junction This causes the muscle to contract (move) But in someone with myasthenia gravis, the body's own immune system makes antibodies that block the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle. This makes the muscles weaker. The thymus gland, which is part of your immune system, may play a role in myasthenia gravis. Normally, your thymus gland is active and growing when you are a child. It makes white blood cells to fight infections. At puberty, it starts getting smaller and is replaced by fat. It is usually small by the time you are an adult. But in many adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland stays large. And some people with myasthenia gravis can get thymomas, which are tumors of the thymus. The are usually benign (not cancer), but they can sometimes become cancerous . Who is more likely to develop myasthenia gravis? Although myasthenia gravis can affect people of any age, it is most common in young adult women (under age 40) and older men (over age 60). It is usually not inherited (passed down in families). Myasthenia gravis normally does not affect infants. But if you are pregnant and have myasthenia gravis it's possible to pass the antibodies to your fetus. The baby can then be born with neonatal myasthenia. This condition is usually temporary, and the symptoms typically go away within two to three months after birth. What are the symptoms of myasthenia gravis? The symptoms of myasthenia gravis will depend on which muscles are affected. The symptoms often include: Weakness of the eye muscles Drooping of one or both eyelids Blurred or double vision Changes in facial expressions Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Speech problems Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Different people have different levels of muscle weakness. And the weakness can vary from day to day. Some days it might be mild, and other days it might be worse. Physical activity often makes the muscle weakness worse. Some people with myasthenia gravis can get severe weakness that affects the muscles that control breathing. This is called a myasthenic crisis, and it is a life-threatening emergency. How is myasthenia gravis diagnosed? There are many other conditions that can cause muscle weakness, so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. To find out if you have myasthenia gravis, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, including a neurological exam Will likely order tests for myasthenia gravis , including: Blood tests Imaging tests Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies What are the treatments for myasthenia gravis? There is no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatments that can improve muscle weakness and help with symptoms. They include: Anticholinesterase medicines, which can improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Immunosuppressive medicines, which are medicines that decrease your body's immune system responses. They can lower your body's production of abnormal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, which can also help decrease your body's immune system responses. Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous immunoglobulin, which are procedures to remove abnormal antibodies from your blood. They are usually used in severe cases. They can help with symptoms for a few weeks or months. Thymectomy, surgery to remove the thymus gland. It can reduce the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, possibly by rebalancing the immune system. Lifestyle changes may be helpful for some people. The changes could include regular gentle exercise, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods. Some people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms. The remission is usually temporary, but sometimes it can be permanent.

Neuroblastoma may also begin in the neck, chest or spinal cord. What causes neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma is caused by changes in your genes . Gene changes also called gene variants or mutations. In most cases, the cause of the mutation is unknown. In some other cases, the mutation is passed from the parent to the child. What are the symptoms of neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma often begins in early childhood . Sometimes it begins before a child is born.The most common symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.They include: A lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest Bulging eyes Dark circles around the eyes Bone pain Swollen stomach and trouble breathing in babies Painless, bluish lumps under the skin in babies Weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part) How is neuroblastoma diagnosed? To diagnose neuroblastoma, your child's health care provider will do various tests and procedures, which may include: A medical history. A neurological exam . Imaging test s, such as x-rays , a CT scan , an ultrasound , an MRI , or an MIBG scan. In an MIBG scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and attaches itself to any neuroblastoma cells. A scanner detects the cells. Blood and urine tests. Biopsy , in which a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, in which bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone are removed for testing. What are the treatments for neuroblastoma? The treatments for neuroblastoma include: Observation, also called watchful waiting, is where the health care provider does not give any treatments until your child's signs or symptoms appear or change. Surgery Radiation therapy . Chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue. Your child will get high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This kills the cancer cells, but it also kills healthy cells. So your child will get a stem cell transplant , usually of his or her own cells collected earlier. This helps to replace the healthy cells that were lost. Iodine 131-MIBG therapy, a treatment with radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine collects in neuroblastoma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.

There are three types of neurofibromatosis: Type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes and deformed bones. It usually starts in childhood. Sometimes the symptoms are present at birth. Type 2 (NF2) causes hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and poor balance. Symptoms often start in the teen years. Schwannomatosis causes intense pain. It is the rarest type. Doctors diagnose the different types based on the symptoms. Genetic testing is also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. There is no cure. Treatment can help control symptoms.

It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back , abdomen , chest , pelvis , or you may feel pain all over. There are two types of pain: Acute pain usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation (irritation, redness, and/or swelling). It usually goes away when the cause is treated or healed, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain . Chronic pain lasts for longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed. It can cause severe problems. What are pain relievers? Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve pain. There are many pain medicines, each with advantages and risks. Some are over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Others are stronger medicines, which are available by prescription. The most powerful prescription pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but people who take them are at risk of addiction and overdose . Because of the side effects and risks of pain relievers, you may want to try non-drug treatments first. If you need to take medicines, doing some non-drug treatments may allow you to take a lower dose. What are some non-drug treatments for pain? Many non-drug treatments can help with pain. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them: Acupuncture involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that triggering the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions. Biofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain. Electrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by changing or blocking pain signals. Types include: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) Implanted electric nerve stimulation Deep brain or spinal cord stimulation Massage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain. Meditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings. Physical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, condition muscles and restore strength. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by: Teaching them coping skills to better deal with the stress that pain can cause Addressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse Providing them with support Relaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation.

These include changes in your: Home life, such as suddenly living alone or having trouble getting around Health, which can make it harder for you to cook or feed yourself Medicines, which can change how food tastes, make your mouth dry, or take away your appetite Income, which means that you may not have as much money for food Sense of smell and taste Problems chewing or swallowing your food How can I eat healthy as I age? To stay healthy as you age, you should: Eat foods that give you lots of nutrients without a lot of extra calories , such as Fruits and vegetables (choose different types with bright colors) Whole grains, like oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice Fat-free or low-fat milk and cheese, or soy or rice milk that has added vitamin D and calcium Seafood, lean meats, poultry, and eggs Beans, nuts, and seeds Avoid empty calories. These are foods with lots of calories but few nutrients, such as chips, candy, baked goods, soda, and alcohol. Pick foods that are low in cholesterol and fat. You especially want to try to avoid saturated and trans fats. Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Trans fats are processed fats in stick margarine and vegetable shortening. You may find them in some store-bought baked goods and fried foods at some fast-food restaurants. Drink enough liquids , so you don't get dehydrated . Some people lose their sense of thirst as they age. And certain medicines might make it even more important to have plenty of fluids. Be physically active. If you have started losing your appetite, exercising may help you to feel hungrier. What can I do if I am having trouble eating healthy? Sometimes health issues or other problems can make it hard to eat healthy.

{"chunk_id": "61_1", "topic_id": "61", "topic_title": "Obesity", "content": "What is obesity? Obesity is a disease that means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that your weight is greater than what's considered healthy for your height. Body Mass Index (BMI) measures how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. An adult who has a BMI of 30 or more is considered to have obesity. Severe obesity is having a BMI of 40 or higher. Obesity increases your risk for many other diseases and health problems, especially if the extra body fat is carried around the waist. What raises your risk of obesity? Obesity happens over time from taking in more calories (through food and drinks) than used up from physical activity and daily living. Your body stores the extra calories as fat. The right balance between calories and activity is different for everyone. There are many different factors that can affect your body weight . Certain medicines or medical conditions may affect your weight. Other factors include your: Genetic makeup Eating habits Sex Race or ethnicity Physical activity level How is obesity diagnosed? To find out if you have obesity, your health care provider may: Ask about your health history , which may include reviewing your weight history, weight-loss efforts, and how physically active you are. Do a physical exam , which may include checking your height, weight, and vital signs , as well as listening to your heart and lungs. Order blood tests or other imaging tests , which may include checking any known health problems, as well as for other weight-related diseases and health conditions. Calculate your BMI , to check your risk for certain diseases. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It may also overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons, or others who have lost muscle. Check your waist size , since a large waistline, with more body fat around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, increases your risk for weight-related health problems. What health problems can obesity cause? Having a larger body size can make your heart work harder, put extra pressure on your joints, and may increase your risk for many health conditions, including: Type 2 diabetes . Heart disease . High blood pressure . Stroke . Metabolic syndrome . Osteoarthritis . Sleep apnea . Pregnancy problems . Fertility problems . Some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds. What are the treatments for obesity? Treatment plans for obesity may depend on your overall weight, other health conditions, and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan . Your provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight. They may refer you to other providers that specialize in nutrition or weight loss to help you make realistic goals and provide support.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which you have thoughts (obsessions) and rituals (compulsions) over and over. They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them. What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role. Who is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls. Risk factors for OCD include: Family history. People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen. Brain structure and functioning. Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD. Childhood trauma, such as child abuse . Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better. In some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following a streptococcal infection . This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS). What are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both: Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety . They may involve things such as Fear of germs or contamination Fear of losing or misplacing something Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way Compulsions are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions include Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off Compulsive counting Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way Some people with OCD also have Tourette syndrome or another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do over and over. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things. How is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed? The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. It's important to check whether a physical problem is causing your symptoms. So your provider will do a physical exam and will ask you about your medical history. If your symptoms do not seem to be caused by a physical problem, your provider may do an OCD test or may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder. Not everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you: Can't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive Spend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors Don't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety. Have significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to your obsessions and compulsions. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause. Medicines for OCD include certain types of antidepressants . If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine. If you have severe OCD that does not get better with these treatments, your provider may suggest a treatment called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves. It can target specific brain areas associated with OCD.

They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain . Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose . These risks increase when these medicines are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids. What is an opioid overdose? Opioids affect the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When people take high doses of opioids, it can lead to an overdose, with the slowing or stopping of breathing and sometimes death. What causes an opioid overdose? An opioid overdose can happen for a variety of reasons, including if you: Take an opioid to get high. Take an extra dose of a prescription opioid or take it too often (either accidentally or on purpose). Mix an opioid with other medicines, illegal drugs, or alcohol. An overdose can be fatal when mixing an opioid and certain anxiety treatment medicines, such as Xanax or Valium. Take an opioid medicine that was prescribed for someone else. Children are especially at risk of an accidental overdose if they take medicine not intended for them. There is also a risk of overdose if you are getting medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD is a treatment for OUD . Many of the medicines used for MOUD are also controlled substances that can be misused. Who is at risk of an opioid overdose? Anyone who takes an opioid can be at risk of an overdose, but you are at higher risk if you: Take illegal opioids Take more opioid medicine than you are prescribed Combine opioids with other medicines and/or alcohol Have certain medical conditions, such as sleep apnea , or reduced kidney or liver function Are over 65 years old What are the signs of an opioid overdose? The signs of an opioid overdose include: Very small pupils of the eyes Falling asleep or loss of consciousness Slow, shallow breathing Choking or gurgling sounds Vomiting Limp body Pale, blue, or cold skin Faint heartbeat Purple lips and fingernails What should I do if I think that someone is having an opioid overdose? If you think someone is having an opioid overdose: Call 911 immediately . Give the person naloxone, if it is available. Naloxone is a safe medication that can quickly stop an opioid overdose. There are two forms. One is a nasal spray that you spray info the nose. The other type is injected into the muscle under the skin, or into the veins. Naloxone works by blocking the effects of the opioids on the body. It's important to read the product instructions and check the expiration date before you give it to someone. Try to keep the person awake and breathing. Lay the person on their side to prevent choking. Stay with the person until emergency workers arrive. Naloxone won't harm someone if they're overdosing on drugs other than opioids, so it's best to use it if you think someone is overdosing. Can an opioid overdose be prevented? If you are taking opioid pain medicine, there are steps you can take to help prevent an opioid overdose: Take your medicine exactly as prescribed by your provider. Do not take more medicine at once or take medicine more often than you are supposed to. Never mix the pain medicines with alcohol, sleeping pills, or illegal substances. Store your medicine safely where children or pets can't reach it. Consider using a medicine lockbox. Besides keeping children safe, it also prevents someone who lives with you or visits your house from stealing your medicines. Dispose of unused medicine promptly.

You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain . What are the side effects and risks of opioids? Opioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness, mental fog, nausea, and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing, which can lead to overdose deaths.

These signs may include: Very small pupils of the eyes Falling asleep or loss of consciousness Slow, shallow breathing Choking or gurgling sounds Vomiting Limp body Pale, blue, or cold skin Faint heartbeat Purple lips and fingernails When using opioids, there is also a risk of opioid use disorder (OUD). What is opioid use disorder (OUD)? Opioid use disorder (OUD) means that you have a problematic pattern of using opioids. The pattern causes a lot of distress and impairment (meaning that it causes problems in and interferes with your daily life). Instead of OUD, sometimes people use the terms \"opioid dependence\" and \"opioid addiction.\" Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm. The risk of OUD is higher if you misuse the medicines . Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids. Opioid use disorder and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States. As more people misuse opioids, more women are misusing opioids during pregnancy . This can lead to health risks for the mother and baby. The baby may be born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a group of withdrawal symptoms that a baby has after being exposed to drugs during pregnancy. Another problem with increased opioid misuse is that it can also lead to more heroin use. There are some people who switch from prescription opioids to heroin because heroin may be cheaper and easier to get. How are opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose treated? There are effective medicines to treat OUD . Using medicines to treat OUD is called medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD can help you stop using the drug, get through withdrawal, and cope with cravings. It is often combined with behavioral therapy and counseling. Having support from family and friends can also help. There is also a medicine called naloxone which can treat opioid overdoses. It can reverse the effects of the overdose and prevent death if it is given quickly. How can I prevent problems when taking prescription opioids? To prevent problems with prescription opioids , be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else.

The disease can develop when your bone mineral density and bone mass decrease. It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change. Osteoporosis is called a \"silent\" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist. What causes osteoporosis? Your bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease. Who is more likely to develop osteoporosis? Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but you are more likely to develop it if you have one or more risk factors: Your sex. Osteoporosis is more common in women, especially after menopause (postmenopausal). Your age. Your risk increases as you get older. It is most common in people over age 50. Your body size. It is more common in people who are slim and thin boned. Your race: White and Asian women are at highest risk. African American and Mexican American women have a lower risk.

Osteoporosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. You may not know that you have it until you break a bone. How is osteoporosis diagnosed? Health care providers often diagnose osteoporosis during routine screening for the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for: Women age 65 and older Postmenopausal women under age 65 who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis For men, it isn't clear yet whether regular screening is helpful. More research is needed to know for sure. To find out if you have osteoporosis, your provider: Will ask about your medical history and whether you have ever broken a bone May do a physical exam, which could include checking for: A loss of height and/or weight Changes in your posture Balance and gait (the way you walk) Your muscle strength Will likely order a bone density scan May do a fracture risk assessment, which is a short questionnaire that helps estimate your risk of breaking a bone in the next 10 years Will likely order a bone density scan May do a fracture risk assessment, which is a short questionnaire that helps estimate your risk of breaking a bone in the next 10 years What are the treatments for osteoporosis? The goals for treating osteoporosis are to slow or stop bone loss and to prevent fractures. Your provider may recommend: A healthy, balanced diet that includes enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and limiting alcohol Regular physical activity including weight-bearing exercise (like walking), strength training, and balance exercises Fall prevention to help prevent fractures Medicines, such as: Medicines that slow down bone loss Medicines that help rebuild bone In addition to managing your osteoporosis, it's important to avoid activities that may cause a fracture. These can include movements that involve: Twisting your spine, like swinging a golf club Bending forward from the waist, like sit ups and toe touches You can also help reduce the risk of breaking a bone by preventing falls. Can osteoporosis be prevented? To help keep bones strong and help prevent osteoporosis, the best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D.

Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow out of control and form a tumor. Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor that forms in the tissues of an ovary. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that make eggs and female hormones . What are the types of ovarian cancer? There are a few different types of ovarian cancer. The most common type is epithelial cancer. It begins in the cells that cover the ovary. There are also two related types of epithelial cancer that can spread to the ovaries: Fallopian tube cancer forms in the tissue lining a fallopian tube. The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes on each side of the uterus. The uterus is the female reproductive organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy. Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the tissue lining the peritoneum. Your peritoneum is a tissue lining that covers the organs in the abdomen (belly). These two cancers are like ovarian cancer, and they have the same treatments. So some medical experts also consider those two types as ovarian cancer. Some other rarer types of ovarian cancer are malignant germ cell tumors and stromal tumors. What causes ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer happens when there are changes (mutations) in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Most ovarian cancers are caused by genetic changes that happen during your lifetime. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Ovarian cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary ovarian cancer. There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 . These two changes also raise your risk of breast and other cancers. Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of ovarian cancer. Who is more likely to develop ovarian cancer? Certain people are more likely to develop ovarian cancer. They include those who: Have a family history of ovarian cancer in a mother, aunt, grandmother, or sister Have inherited changes in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes Have certain other genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome Have endometriosis Took hormone replacement therapy Are overweight or have obesity Are tall Are older, especially those who have gone through menopause Have never been pregnant What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. By the time you do have signs or symptoms, the cancer is often advanced. The signs and symptoms may include: Pain, swelling, or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen (belly) or pelvis Sudden or frequent urge to urinate (pee) Trouble eating or feeling full A lump in the pelvic area Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas , bloating, or constipation How is ovarian cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have ovarian cancer, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history , including your symptoms Will ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had ovarian cancer Will do a physical exam , including a pelvic exam Will likely do imaging tests May do blood tests such as a CA-125 blood test Often the only way to know for sure that you have ovarian cancer is by having a biopsy of the tissue. A biopsy is done during surgery to remove the tumor. What are the treatments for ovarian cancer? Treatments for ovarian cancer may include: Surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible Chemotherapy Targeted therapy , which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Your provider may suggest that you have genetic testing to look for the gene changes that raise the risk for ovarian cancer.

Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues. Certain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath , tired, and confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen. What is oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy. There are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air. There are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy. Who needs oxygen therapy? You may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Pneumonia COVID-19 A severe asthma attack Late-stage heart failure Cystic fibrosis Sleep apnea What are the risks of using oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches. Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright.

Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones. What causes Paget's disease of bone? Researchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease. Who is at risk for Paget's disease of bone? The disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it. What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone? Many people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include: Pain , which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget's Headaches and hearing loss , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull Pressure on the nerves , which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spine Increased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases. Hip pain , if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighbone Damage to the cartilage of your joints , which may lead to arthritis Usually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones. What other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause? Paget's disease can lead to other complications, such as: Arthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the joints Heart failure . In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries . Kidney stones , which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body Nervous system problems , since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord. Osteosarcoma, cancer of the bone Loose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones Vision loss , if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare. How is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam An x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays. An alkaline phosphatase blood test A bone scan Sometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason. What are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone? To avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include: Medicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease. Surgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to Allow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position Replace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis Realign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees Reduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system Diet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements.

It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may be mild or severe. Pain may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back , abdomen , chest , or pelvis , or you may feel it all over. Pain can help alert you that there is a problem. If you never felt pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Finding out what's causing your pain will help your health care provider determine the best way to manage or treat it. What are the types of pain? Patterns and types of pain are named based on how long and how often you have pain. These include: Acute pain usually happens suddenly because of a disease, injury, or inflammation (irritation, redness, and/or swelling). This type of pain is often sharp and acts as a warning that something is wrong. It usually goes away when the cause is treated or healed, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain . Some examples of causes of acute pain include broken bones or dental issues . Chronic pain lasts for longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed. It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Some conditions that might cause chronic pain include arthritis or back problems. Episodic pain can happen from time to time and may occur with long-term medical conditions. Some conditions that might cause episodic pain include sickle cell disease or chronic migraines . Pain may also be categorized by what is likely to be the cause of the pain. Pain may be described as nociceptive (caused by tissue damage or inflammation), neuropathic (caused by nerve damage), or nociplastic (caused by changes in how your nervous system processes pain). What causes pain? Understanding what causes pain and why people feel it differently may be difficult. Often, it's easier to find the cause of acute pain due to an injury than the cause of chronic pain, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as cancer . In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as stress and beliefs about pain may affect the way you feel pain and respond to treatment. How is pain diagnosed? You are the only one who knows how your pain feels. Your provider can best measure your pain by how you report it. They may ask you: Where is the pain in your body? How long have you had the pain? How does the pain feel, such as stinging, burning, or sharp? How often do you have pain? When do you feel pain, such as in the morning, evening, or all the time? What relieves the pain? How does pain affect your daily life? Is the pain mild, moderate, or severe? To rate the pain on a scale. If the cause of your pain is unknown, your provider may also do a physical exam and order blood tests or other medical tests to help find the cause. What are the treatments for pain? Pain is not always curable, but there are many ways to manage and treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. Treatments may include medicines, such as pain relievers . There are also non-drug treatments , such as acupuncture , physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.

Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches , sore muscles, arthritis , or other aches and pains . There are many different pain medicines, and each with advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. What are the types of over-the-counter pain relievers? Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. Two types of OTC pain medicines are usually recommended for mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used in many OTC and prescription medicines. It's often considered safer than other pain relievers. Unfortunately, it's common for people to take too much accidentally . Be careful not to take too much each day or use more than one medicine with acetaminophen. Check with your health care provider before taking medicines containing acetaminophen for more than ten days or five days for your child. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). These pain relievers are often most effective if you have pain and inflammation (swelling), such as for arthritis or menstrual cramps . If you take more than the recommended amount, NSAIDs may cause nausea , stomach pain, or ulcers. What are prescription pain relievers? If OTC pain relievers don't relieve your pain, your provider may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are opioids, sometimes called narcotics. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine.

It causes repeated panic attacks, which are sudden periods of intense fear, discomfort, or a sense of losing control. These attacks happen even though there is no real danger. They often cause physical symptoms. For example, you may have a rapid or pounding heartbeat and feel like you are having a heart attack . If you have panic attacks, it doesn't mean you will develop a panic disorder. Many people only have one or two panic attacks in their lifetime and get better without treatment. But some of the people who have panic attacks do develop panic disorder. They have repeated panic attacks. The attacks can happen as often as several times a day or as rarely as a few times a year. People with panic disorder often worry about having another attack. It may cause them to avoid places and situations where they had panic attacks in the past. Panic disorder is not life-threatening, but it can be upsetting and affect your quality of life. And if it is not treated, it can sometimes lead to other health conditions, including depression and substance use disorders. What causes panic disorder? The cause of panic disorder is unknown. Researchers think that certain factors may play a role: Genetics - panic disorder sometimes runs in families. But no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don't. Brain biology and chemistry. Your environment. Major stress . Who is more likely to develop panic disorder? Panic disorder is more common in women than men. It often starts in the late teens or early adulthood. Sometimes it starts when a person is under a lot of stress. People who have had trauma, especially in childhood, are more likely to develop panic disorder. What are the symptoms of panic disorder? People with panic disorder may have: Sudden and repeated panic attacks of overwhelming anxiety and fear A feeling of being out of control or a fear of death during a panic attack An intense worry about another panic attack A fear or avoidance of places and situations where they had panic attacks in the past Physical symptoms during a panic attack, such as: Pounding or racing heart Sweating or chills Trembling or shaking Trouble breathing The feeling that they are choking Weakness or dizziness Chest pain Stomach pain or nausea Panic attacks can happen anytime, without warning. They can last anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour. How is panic disorder diagnosed? To find out if you have panic disorder, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms May check if an unrelated physical problem is causing your symptoms, for example with: A physical exam Blood tests to check for thyroid problems and other possible conditions Heart health tests May do a panic disorder test May refer you to a mental health provider for the panic disorder test or other types of psychological evaluations What are the treatments for panic disorder? Treatment for panic disorder usually includes one or more of the following: Talk therapy , also called psychotherapy or counseling, which can help you understand your feelings. It may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy that helps you change your negative thoughts and how you react to things that cause you to feel anxiety.

PID is the most common preventable cause of infertility in the United States. What causes pelvic inflammatory disease? Many types of bacteria can cause PID, but it's often caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common causes of PID. You are at greater risk for PID if you: Are sexually active and younger than age 25. Have more than one sex partner. Douche. Douching can push bacteria into your reproductive organs. It may also hide the signs of PID. Have an STI and do not get treated. Have had PID or an STI before. It's not as common, but sometimes using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control can increase your risk for PID. However, your risk is usually only during the first three weeks after the IUD is placed inside your uterus. What are the symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease? If you have PID, you may have mild or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, the most common symptom is pain in the lower abdomen (belly). Other symptoms can include: Fever Foul-smelling vaginal discharge Bleeding between periods Pain or bleeding during sex Painful urination (peeing) See your health care provider if you have any symptoms of PID or if you think you or your partner were exposed to an STI. Early treatment is important. Waiting too long for treatment increases the risk of infertility. How is pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosed? There is no one test for PID. To check for PID, your provider may: Ask about your medical and sexual history Review your symptoms Do a pelvic exam Order blood, urine, and i maging tests What is the treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease? Antibiotics are used to treat PID. You must take all the medicine, even if your symptoms go away to make sure the infection is cured. You will likely need to follow up with your provider to make sure the treatment is working. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can get tested and treated. Don't have sex until you finish treatment, otherwise you can reinfect each other. If you're pregnant, have an abscess, or your symptoms don't go away, you may need to have surgery or be hospitalized for treatment.

The pain is most often menstrual cramps, which are a throbbing, cramping pain in your lower abdomen. You may also have other symptoms, such as lower back pain, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Period pain is not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS causes many different symptoms, including weight gain, bloating, irritability, and fatigue. PMS often starts one to two weeks before your period starts. What causes painful periods? There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Each type has different causes. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common kind of period pain. It is period pain that is not caused by another condition. The cause is usually having too many prostaglandins, which are chemicals that your uterus makes. These chemicals make the muscles of your uterus tighten and relax, and this causes the cramps. The pain can start a day or two before your period. It normally lasts for a few days, though in some women it can last longer. You usually first start having period pain when you are younger, just after you begin getting periods. Often, as you get older, you have less pain. The pain may also get better after you have given birth. Secondary dysmenorrhea often starts later in life. It is caused by conditions that affect your uterus or other reproductive organs, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids . This kind of pain often gets worse over time. It may begin before your period starts and continue after your period ends. What can I do about period pain? To help ease your period pain, you can try: Using a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower abdomen Getting some exercise Taking a hot bath Doing relaxation techniques, including yoga and meditation You might also try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Besides relieving pain, NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins that your uterus makes and lessen their effects. This helps to lessen the cramps. You can take NSAIDs when you first have symptoms, or when your period starts. You can keep taking them for a few days. You should not take NSAIDS if you have ulcers or other stomach problems, bleeding problems, or liver disease. You should also not take them if you are allergic to aspirin. Always check with your health care provider if you are not sure whether or not you should take NSAIDs. It may also help to get enough rest and avoid using alcohol and tobacco. When should I get medical help for my period pain? For many women, some pain during your period is normal. However, you should contact your health care provider if: NSAIDs and self-care measures don't help, and the pain interferes with your life Your cramps suddenly get worse You are over 25 and you get severe cramps for the first time You have a fever with your period pain You have the pain even when you are not getting your period How is the cause of severe period pain diagnosed? To diagnose severe period pain, your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a pelvic exam. You may also have an ultrasound or other imaging test . If your health care provider thinks you have secondary dysmenorrhea, you might have laparoscopy . It is a surgery that that lets your health care provider look inside your body. What are treatments for severe period pain? If your period pain is primary dysmenorrhea and you need medical treatment, your health care provider might suggest using hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD. Another treatment option might be prescription pain relievers. If you have secondary dysmenorrhea, your treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the problem. In some cases, you may need surgery.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 665, "char_count": 3943, "synonyms": ["Dysmenorrhea", "Menstrual cramps", "Menstrual pain"], "mesh_terms": ["Dysmenorrhea"], "search_terms": ["dysmenorrhea", "menstrual pain", "menstrual cramps", "period pain"], "quality_score": 70.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/periodpain.html"},

Nerves are like wires that carry messages back and forth between your brain and your body. Your peripheral nerves branch off from your brain and spinal cord and connect to all parts of your body, including your muscles and organs. Peripheral nerves carry messages from your brain that control your movement, breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and more. They also carry messages from your body to your brain, so you can feel things, such as pain, heat, and cold. What are peripheral nerve disorders? Peripheral nerve disorders happen when one or more peripheral nerves are damaged. Damaged nerves may not carry messages correctly, or they may not work at all. As a result, you may have pain , trouble walking , or a variety of other problems, depending on which nerves are involved. Peripheral nerve disorders are very common. There are more than 100 different types. What causes peripheral nerve disorders? Many things can damage nerves and lead to peripheral nerve disorders: Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral nerve disorders. Most people with diabetes will develop diabetic nerve problems . Physical injury ( trauma ) that stretches, crushes, squeezes, cuts, or puts pressure on one or more nerves. Some examples of peripheral nerve disorders from physical injury include complex regional pain syndrome and brachial plexus injuries . Health conditions , including: Certain cancers and their treatment ( chemotherapy and radiation therapy ). Infections , such as HIV and Lyme disease . Problems with blood or blood vessels . Autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . Kidney or liver disease . Certain medicines. Contact with certain toxic substances , such as lead or mercury . Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smoking . Vitamin imbalances , especially a lack of vitamin B12 . Your genes , including changes in your genes or conditions that you inherit from your parents, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease . In certain cases, the cause of peripheral nerve disorder is not known. What are the symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders? The symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders depend on which nerves are affected, what is causing the damage, and how serious it is: Types of nerves Possible symptoms of nerve damage Motor nerves control your muscles and all your movement, such as walking, talking, and using your hands. Weak or aching muscles Problems with balance, walking, or using your arms and hands Cramps or twitching muscles Muscle shrinking Sensory nerves carry messages to your brain from your senses, including touch, hot and cold, and pain. Tingling, numbness, or pain often in the hands and feet Not being able to feel heat, cold, or pain, such as a cut on your foot Pain from even light touch Autonomic nerves send messages to your organs to control breathing, digestion, and other body functions that happen without thinking about them. A heartbeat that's too fast or too slow Trouble swallowing Sweating too much or too little Vomiting , diarrhea , or constipation Problems with urination or sexual function Symptoms may range from mild to very strong. They may develop quickly over days or slowly over months and years. But they are rarely life-threatening. How are peripheral nerve disorders diagnosed? To find out if you have a peripheral nerve disorder, your provider will: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history Do a physical exam Order tests, which may include: Blood tests Genetic tests Nerve tests that measure: Electrical activity in your nerves and muscles How well your autonomic nerves are working A biopsy of nerve or skin tissue CT or MRI scan to see what may be pressing on your nerves What are the treatments for peripheral nerve disorders? It's important to treat any conditions that are causing nerve damage. In certain cases, that will allow your nerves to heal over time. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of peripheral nerve disorder you have, where it is, and how severe. Treatment options include: Braces or splints Over-the-counter patches and skin creams Prescription medicines Non-drug pain management , such as electrical stimulation or relaxation therapy Surgery to relieve pressure on a nerve Can peripheral nerve disorders be prevented?

Personality disorders are a group of mental disorders . They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are different from what is considered normal in your culture. The thoughts and behaviors are unhealthy and inflexible. They cause serious problems with relationships, work, and social activities. They can make it hard to deal with everyday stresses and problems. What are the types of personality disorders? There are 10 types of personality disorders.

Narcissistic personality disorder, in which a person lacks empathy and wants to be admired by others. They think that they are better than others and that they deserve special treatment. Cluster C personality disorders involve anxious and fearful thoughts and behaviors. It includes: Avoidant personality disorder, in which a person is very shy and feels that they are not as good as others. They often avoid people because they fear rejection. Dependent personality disorder, in which a person depends too much on others and feels that they need to be taken care of. They may let others treat them badly because they are afraid of losing the relationship. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, in which a person needs control and order. They are perfectionists and can be inflexible. Although some of the symptoms are similar, this is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). What causes personality disorders? Personality disorders usually begin when someone is in their teens or early adult years. The cause is unknown. However, genes and childhood experiences such as abuse and trauma likely play a role. What are the symptoms of personality disorders? The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. But each disorder involves problems and uncertainty with how people see themselves. The disorders also cause problems in relationships with other people. People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help. How are personality disorders diagnosed? A mental health care provider can diagnose personality disorders. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. To make a diagnosis, the provider will consider the person's symptoms, experiences, and family medical history. A thorough medical exam may also be done to help rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. How are personality disorders treated?

But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. What causes prediabetes? Prediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be: Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level Researchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes. Who is at risk for prediabetes? About 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes.

They include getting regular prenatal care , eating healthy , and staying active. But it's also very important to avoid substances that could be harmful to you and your baby, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Tobacco Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine, carbon monoxide , and many other harmful chemicals to your baby. Nicotine is not only a health danger for you, but it can also damage your developing baby's brain and lungs. Carbon monoxide can keep the developing baby from getting enough oxygen. If you smoke while pregnant, it raises the risk of your baby being born too small , too early , or with birth defects . During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of your baby dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). And later in life, your child may be more likely to have health problems, such as asthma and obesity . Other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes , also contain nicotine and are not safe to use during pregnancy. And some of the flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be harmful to developing babies. You will also want to try to avoid secondhand smoke , which has some of the same risks as smoking during pregnancy. Alcohol There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for you to drink during pregnancy and while trying to get pregnant. All types of alcohol are equally harmful, including all wines and beer. The risks from drinking during pregnancy include problems with the growth of the developing baby and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD is a life-long condition that can cause a mix of physical, behavioral, and learning problems. Illegal drugs Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine , methamphetamines , and club drugs , during pregnancy can cause problems for both you and your baby. They may cause low birth weight babies, birth defects, or miscarriage . Your child may be more likely to have learning and developmental disabilities. And if you are injecting the drugs, that puts you at risk for HIV . HIV can be passed along to your baby during pregnancy . Prescription drug misuse Misusing prescription drugs can also be harmful. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's medicines. The possible effects of misusing a medicine during pregnancy will depend on which medicine you are misusing. Opioids One type of drug that is a concern during pregnancy is opioids . Opioids include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The risks include birth defects, preterm birth, the loss of the baby, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS causes withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies. If you have pain and your health care provider suggests that you take prescription opioids during pregnancy, first discuss the risks and benefits with the provider. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you can work together to try to minimize the risks. Cannabis (marijuana) Cannabis (marijuana) is another drug that could be harmful to your baby. Some research shows that using cannabis during pregnancy is linked to developmental problems in children and teens. More research is needed, but the safest thing to do is stop using it if you are pregnant. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that people should not use cannabis while they are pregnant. Getting help If you are pregnant and using any of these substances, contact your provider. Together you and your provider can find the right treatment to help you quit. If you are taking opioids or are addicted to drugs, don't stop taking them suddenly. That can be dangerous to you and the baby.

They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and body lice . Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type. How do pubic lice spread? Pubic lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They usually spread through sexual contact. Occasionally, they may spread through physical contact with a person who has pubic lice, or through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with pubic lice. You cannot get pubic lice from animals. Who is at risk for pubic lice? Since they spread mainly through sexual contact, pubic lice are most common in adults. What are the symptoms of pubic lice? The most common symptom of pubic lice is intense itching in the genital area. You may also see nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice. How do you know if you have pubic lice? A diagnosis of a pubic lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. But lice and nits can be difficult to find because there may be only a few present. Also, they often attach themselves to more than one hair, and they do not crawl as quickly as head and body lice. Sometimes it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits. People who have pubic lice should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and their sexual partners should also be checked for pubic lice. What are the treatments for pubic lice? The main treatment for pubic lice is a lice-killing lotion. Options include a lotion that contains permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription. They are safe and effective when you use them according to the instructions. Usually one treatment will get rid of the lice. If not, you may need another treatment after 9-10 days. There are other lice-killing medicines that are available with a prescription from your health care provider. You should also wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer.

{"chunk_id": "377_1", "topic_id": "377", "topic_title": "Pulmonary Embolism", "content": "What is a pulmonary embolism (PE)? A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. It usually happens when a blood clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. PE is a serious condition that can cause: Permanent damage to the lungs Low oxygen levels in your blood Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen PE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots. What causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)? The cause is usually a blood clot that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. The clot is usually a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in the leg. In rare cases, material such as air bubbles, clumps of fat, or parts of a tumor can block the lung artery and cause PE. Who is more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Anyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE: Having surgery, especially joint replacement surgery. Certain medical conditions, including Cancers Heart diseases Lung diseases A broken hip or leg bone or other trauma Hormone-based medicines, such as birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy . Pregnancy and childbirth. The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth. Not moving for long periods, such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight. Age. Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40. Family history and genetics. Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE. Obesity . What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Symptoms of PE include: Shortness of breath Rapid breathing Chest pain or discomfort, which usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath Increased heart rate Coughing up blood Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting Sometimes people with PE don't have any symptoms until they have serious complications, such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs). How is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed? It can be difficult to diagnose PE. To find out if you have a PE, your health care provider will: Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE Do a physical exam Likely order some tests, including various imaging and blood tests What are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)? If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures. Medicines : Anticoagulants, or blood thinners , keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin. Thrombolytics are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening. Procedures : Catheter-assisted thrombus removal uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure. A vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming. Can pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented? Preventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include: Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, quitting smoking . Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Pulmonary hypertension, sometimes called PH, is a serious condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal. Your heart pumps blood to your lungs so they can add oxygen to the blood. The blood goes back to your heart. From there, it travels to the rest of your body so that your tissues can get the oxygen that they need. The blood moves from your heart to your lungs through blood vessels called pulmonary arteries. If the pulmonary arteries become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, the blood does not flow through them as well. This can increase the blood pressure in the arteries and cause pulmonary hypertension. There are different types of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The different types are based on what caused the disease. What causes pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension can develop on its own or be caused by another condition. Sometimes the cause is unknown or is not clear. Some of the possible causes include: Heart diseases , including left-sided heart failure and congenital heart disease Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease , emphysema , and sleep apnea Other medical conditions such as: Liver diseases Sickle cell disease Pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs) Connective tissue disorders like scleroderma Who is more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension? Certain factors can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension, such as: Your age. The risk increases as you get older. The condition is usually diagnosed between ages 30 and 60. Your environment. Being exposed to asbestos or having certain infections caused by parasites can raise your risk. Your family history and genetics. Certain genetic disorders , such as Down syndrome , congenital heart disease, and Gaucher disease , can raise your risk of pulmonary hypertension. So can a family history of blood clots . Your lifestyle habits. Smoking and illegal drug use can raise your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Certain medicines. For example, some medicines used to treat cancer and depression can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension. Your sex. Pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than in men. What are the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension? The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are sometimes hard to recognize and are similar to the symptoms of other medical conditions. So sometimes it can take years for someone to get diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include: Shortness of breath Chest pain or pressure Dizziness that may lead to fainting Fatigue Swelling of the abdomen, legs, or feet Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is pounding or beating too fast) What other problems can pulmonary hypertension cause? Pulmonary hypertension can get worse over time and lead to serious problems, including: Anemia , which can cause your body to not get enough oxygen-rich blood Arrhythmias , problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries Bleeding in the lungs Heart failure Liver damage Pericardial effusion, a collection of fluid around the heart Serious pregnancy complications How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed? To find out if you have pulmonary hypertension, your health care provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, which may include checking your blood oxygen, listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure Will likely order some tests, such as: Blood tests to look for blood clots, stress on the heart, or anemia Heart imaging tests, such as a cardiac MRI Lung imaging tests, such as chest x-ray An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) What are the treatments for pulmonary hypertension? Often there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but treatments can help manage your symptoms. Your provider will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. It will be based on your needs and the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. The plan may include: Healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Healthy eating , which includes eating less salt Regular physical activity , which may be done through pulmonary rehabilitation Medicines, such as: Blood thinners Medicines to control the rate blood is pumped throughout the body Medicines to relax blood vessels and allow the blood to flow better Medicine to reduce swelling (diuretics) Oxygen therapy Procedures to reduce pressure in the heart or pulmonary artery In some severe cases, a lung transplant NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 747, "char_count": 4720, "synonyms": ["Pulmonary arterial hypertension"], "mesh_terms": ["Hypertension, Pulmonary"], "search_terms": ["pulmonary hypertension", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "hypertension, pulmonary"], "quality_score": 62.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html"},

Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as pulmonary rehab or PR, is a program for people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems . It can help improve your ability to function and quality of life. PR does not replace your medical treatment. Instead, you use them together. PR is often an outpatient program that you do in a hospital or clinic. Some people have PR in their homes. You work with a team of health care providers to find ways to lessen your symptoms, increase your ability to exercise, and make it easier to do your daily activities. Who needs pulmonary rehabilitation? Your health care provider may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) if you have a chronic lung disease or another condition that makes it hard for you to breathe and limits your activities. For example, PR may help you if you: Have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The two main types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis . In COPD, your airways (tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs) are partially blocked. This makes it hard to get air in and out. Have an interstitial lung disease such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis . These diseases cause scarring of the lungs over time. This makes it hard to get enough oxygen. Have cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to collect in the lungs and block the airways. Need lung surgery. You may have PR before and after lung surgery to help you prepare for and recover from the surgery. Have a muscle-wasting disorder that affects the muscles used for breathing. An example is muscular dystrophy . PR works best if you start it before your disease is severe. However, even people who have advanced lung disease can benefit from PR. What does pulmonary rehabilitation include? When you first start pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), your team of health care providers will want to learn more about your health. You will have lung function, exercise, and possibly blood tests. Your team will go over your medical history and current treatments. They may check on your mental health and ask about your diet. Then they will work together to create a plan that is right for you. It may include: Exercise training. Your team will come up with an exercise plan to improve your endurance and muscle strength. You will likely have exercises for both your arms and legs. You might use a treadmill, stationary bike, or weights. You may need to start slowly and increase your exercise as you get stronger. Nutritional counseling. Being either overweight or underweight can affect your breathing. A nutritious eating plan can help you work towards a healthy weight. Education about your disease and how to manage it. This includes learning how to avoid situations that make your symptoms worse, how to avoid infections, and how/when to take your medicines. Techniques you can use to save your energy. Your team may teach you easier ways to do daily tasks. For example, you may learn ways to avoid reaching, lifting, or bending. Those movements make it harder to breathe, since they use up energy and make you tighten your abdominal muscles. You may also learn how to better deal with stress , since stress can also take up energy and affect your breathing. Breathing strategies. You will learn techniques to improve your breathing. These techniques may increase your oxygen levels, decrease how often you take breaths, and keep your airways open longer. Psychological counseling and/or group support. It can feel scary to have trouble breathing. If you have a chronic lung disease, you are more likely to have depression , anxiety , or other emotional problems. Many PR programs include counseling and/or support groups. If not, your PR team may be able to refer you to an organization that offers them.

Besides being the leading cause of cancer in the United States, smoking tobacco harms most organs of your body and causes many other health problems. Tobacco smoke contains many chemicals and can even be harmful even if you don't smoke. Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. If you're pregnant , it can harm your fetus. It can be difficult to quit smoking. That's because smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it harder to stop, but quitting smoking can improve the quality and length of your life. What are the benefits of quitting smoking? Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the higher your risk. Quitting smoking can help reduce your risk of health problems as well as improve the quality of your life. Some initial benefits of quitting include: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen) Better circulation Less coughing and wheezing Sense of smell and taste return In the long term, quitting tobacco can help you live a longer life. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free. How can I quit smoking? There are many ways to quit smoking. Common methods used to help quit smoking include: Counseling with a health care provider about your smoking habits, readiness to quit, and setting a quit date. Smoking aids such as nicotine replacement products or medicines to help reduce nicotine addiction. These may not be right for you if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, a teenager, or if you have certain medical issues or take certain medicines. Smoking reduction by slowly reducing the number of cigarettes per day, or stopping smoking altogether, often called \"cold turkey.\" You may need to try different things, but a mixture of counseling and quit-smoking medicine has been shown to be the best method. Some people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help to quit smoking, but that has not been proven. These battery-operated smoking devices look like cigarettes but work differently. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. When you stop or cut back on smoking, you may have short-term effects such as irritability, anxiety, moodiness, weight gain, or trouble sleeping. These are called withdrawal symptoms.

{"chunk_id": "379_1", "topic_id": "379", "topic_title": "Radiation Exposure", "content": "What is radiation? Radiation is energy. It travels in the form of energy waves or high-speed particles. Radiation can occur naturally or be man-made. There are two types: Non-ionizing radiation, which includes radio waves, cell phones, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light Ionizing radiation, which includes ultraviolet radiation, radon , x-rays , and gamma rays What are the sources of radiation exposure? Background radiation is all around us all the time. Most of it forms naturally from minerals. These radioactive minerals are in the ground, soil, water, and even our bodies. Background radiation can also come from outer space and the sun. Other sources are man-made, such as x-rays, radiation therapy to treat cancer, and electrical power lines. What are the health effects of radiation exposure? Radiation has been around us throughout our evolution. So our bodies are designed to deal with the low levels we're exposed to every day. But too much radiation can damage tissues by changing cell structure and damaging DNA. This can cause serious health problems, including cancer. The amount of damage that exposure to radiation can cause depends on several factors, including: The type of radiation The dose (amount) of radiation How you were exposed, such as through skin contact, swallowing or breathing it in, or having rays pass through your body Where the radiation concentrates in the body and how long it stays there How sensitive your body is to radiation. A fetus is most vulnerable to the effects of radiation. Infants, children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to health effects than healthy adults. Being exposed to a lot of radiation over a short period of time, such as from a radiation emergency , can cause skin burns . It may also lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS, or \"radiation sickness\"). The symptoms of ARS include headache and diarrhea. They usually start within hours. Those symptoms will go away and the person will seem healthy for a little while. But then they will get sick again. How soon they get sick again, which symptoms they have, and how sick they get depends on the amount of radiation they received. In some cases, ARS causes death in the following days or weeks. Exposure to low levels of radiation in the environment does not cause immediate health effects. But it can slightly increase your overall risk of cancer. What are the treatments for acute radiation sickness? Before they start treatment, health care professionals need to figure out how much radiation your body absorbed. They will ask about your symptoms, do blood tests, and may use a device that measures radiation. They also try get more information about the exposure, such as what type of radiation it was, how far away you were from the source of the radiation, and how long you were exposed. Treatment focuses on reducing and treating infections, preventing dehydration , and treating injuries and burns. Some people may need treatments that help the bone marrow recover its function. If you were exposed to certain types of radiation, your provider may give you a treatment that limits or removes the contamination that is inside your body. You may also get treatments for your symptoms. How can radiation exposure be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent or reduce radiation exposure: If your health care provider recommends a test that uses radiation, ask about its risks and benefits. In some cases, you may be able to have a different test that does not use radiation. But if you do need a test that uses radiation, do some research into the local imaging facilities. Find one that monitors and uses techniques to reduce the doses they are giving patients. Reduce electromagnetic radiation exposure from your cell phone. At this time, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. More research is needed to be sure. But if you still have concerns, you can reduce how much time you spend on your phone. You can also use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone. If you live in a house, test the radon levels, and if you need to, get a radon reduction system. During a radiation emergency, get inside a building to take shelter. Stay inside, with all of the windows and doors shut. Stay tuned to and follow the advice of emergency responders and officials.

{"chunk_id": "1443_1", "topic_id": "1443", "topic_title": "Radon", "content": "What is radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It is invisible and has no odor or taste. It comes from the normal decay of uranium and thorium. These are two chemical elements that can be found in soil, rock, and groundwater. Radon breaks down quickly, giving off radioactive particles. Over time, breathing in high levels of these particles can cause lung cancer . How would I be exposed to radon? Outdoors, there are low levels of radon in the air. But radon can also be indoors. It can enter homes and buildings through cracks in the floors, walls, or foundations. Certain building materials can give off radon. And sometimes radon gets inside through well water. Radon levels can be higher in homes and buildings that are well insulated, tightly sealed, and/or built on soil that has a lot of uranium and thorium. Basements and first floors usually have the highest radon levels because they are closer to the ground. How does radon cause lung cancer? When you breathe in radon, its radioactive decay products can get trapped in your lungs. They can damage the cells that line your lungs. Over time, it can lead to lung cancer. It may take years before this happens. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer deaths after cigarette smoking . If you smoke and are exposed to radon, your risk of lung cancer is much higher than if you did not smoke. Most radon-related cancer deaths happen in smokers. How do I know if my home has high levels of radon? Testing is the only way to know if there are high levels of radon in your home. You should test your home's radon levels: If it's never been tested or the radon levels are unknown When preparing to buy or sell your house Before and after any renovations, especially after making any repairs to reduce radon levels Before making any lifestyle changes in the home that would cause someone to spend more time in the basement or lower level (such as converting a basement to a bedroom) Testing is fairly inexpensive and easy to do. You can buy a test kit at most hardware stores or hire someone to do a test. It's a good idea to first contact a state or local radon official for advice. They can explain the differences between testing devices and recommend the most appropriate test for your needs. They can also give you a list of qualified radon testers. There are both long- and short-term test kits: Short-term kits measure radon for 2-90 days for quick results Long-term kits measure radon in your home for over 90 days Radon levels can vary from day to day and month to month. So a long-term test will give a better estimate of your average radon level. How can I lower the radon level in my home? If the testing shows that you have an unsafe level of radon in your home, you can have a radon reduction system installed. It can bring the amount of radon down to a safe level. The cost of the system will depend on the size and design of your home. You can also take some other steps to reduce radon levels in your home: Increase air flow in your house by opening windows and using fans and vents to circulate air. But this will only temporarily reduce the radon levels. Seal cracks in floors and walls with plaster, caulk, or other materials designed for this purpose.

The types are based on substances found on your blood cells. Your blood type also has a positive or negative sign. This is called Rh factor, which is a protein. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh-positive. If you don't, you are Rh-negative. Rh factor is inherited (passed down through families). Most people are Rh-positive, meaning they have the Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Being Rh-negative doesn't affect your health, but it can affect the health of your fetus if you are pregnant. What is Rh incompatibility? If you are pregnant and are Rh-negative and your fetus is Rh-positive, it's called Rh incompatibility. Blood from your fetus can cross into your bloodstream, especially during childbirth . If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the fetus's blood as a foreign substance. It will create antibodies (proteins) that can damage their red blood cells. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during your first pregnancy. But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies if the fetus is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. During your next pregnancy, the antibodies can cross the placenta (the organ that grows in the uterus to provide oxygen and nutrients to the fetus ) and attack the red blood cells of the fetus. Rh incompatibility can cause Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a severe type of anemia . How is Rh incompatibility diagnosed? Your health care provider will order blood tests during your first trimester of pregnancy. This is often done at your first prenatal visit . These tests can check if you have Rh factor and if your body has made antibodies. How is Rh incompatibility treated? During your pregnancy , injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. After delivery , if your baby is born Rh-positive, you'll need another injection of the Rh immune globulin. But if you're Rh-negative and your baby is born Rh-negative, you don't need any other treatment. If treatment is needed for the baby, it may include phototherapy (light therapy) if treatment is needed for jaundice , supplements to help the body make red blood cells, or in severe cases a blood transfusion .

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. RA is an autoimmune disease . Although it is most common in the wrist and fingers, this disease can cause your immune system to attack any joint tissue. The inflammation (swelling) that comes with RA can also affect other body parts. Inflammation could cause medical issues in your eyes, skin, heart, nerves, blood, or lungs. RA differs from osteoarthritis , a common arthritis that often comes with age. RA affects the lining of your joints and damages the tissue that covers the ends of the bones in a joint. Eventually, this might cause your joints to not work as well. There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help you manage symptoms, reduce joint damage, and lead a productive life. Who is more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age, but your risk increases as you become an older adult . Your chance of developing RA can also increase if: You're a woman. Women are more likely to get RA than men. You have a family history. If a member of your family has RA, you're more likely to get the disease. You're a smoker. Smoking over a long period of time increases your risk of getting RA and how serious the disease can be. You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting RA. These include obesity , gum disease , and lung disease . What causes rheumatoid arthritis? No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. A few things that might play a part in getting RA include: Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis, but not everyone with these genes gets RA. The environment , which includes things such as cigarette smoke, sometimes triggers RA symptoms. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Researchers think that sex hormones might play a role in getting RA. Women are more likely to develop the disease, and RA symptoms may change during and after pregnancy. What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? Your immune system may start turning against your body's joints and tissues years before you notice any symptoms of RA. The changes from this type of immune malfunction usually settle in your joints. RA affects people differently. You might have the disease for only a short time, or your symptoms might come and go. The severe form can be chronic (long-lasting) and may last a lifetime. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Joint pain or stiffness when moving. This is usually worse in the morning or after inactivity. RA usually affects both joints. If one of your hands or knees is affected, so is the other. Joint tenderness, redness, and warmth. Joint swelling may make daily activities hard. These could include things such as combing your hair, buttoning your clothes, or bending your knees. Fatigue , fever , and a loss of appetite. Hard bumps (rheumatoid nodules) under your skin near the joints. How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed? There's no single test for rheumatoid arthritis. The disease develops over time. At first, you may only have a few symptoms, making it hard to diagnose RA in its early stages. To find out if you have RA, your health care provider may: Ask about your medical history , including your symptoms. Ask about your family health history , including relatives who have had RA. Do a physical exam , which includes checking your joints, looking for rashes or nodules, and listening to your chest for signs of inflammation in your lungs. Order blood tests or imaging studies (x-ray or ultrasound) to make sure other health conditions aren't causing your symptoms since they may be like other types of arthritis and joint conditions. Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care. What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis? There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help prevent your symptoms from getting worse and damaging your joints. Treatment can include medicine, lifestyle changes, and surgery. These may slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling. Your provider may use a combination of treatments. Your treatment may change based on your symptoms.

What are rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries are common. Most of them are wear-and-tear injuries from doing the same arm movements over and over - especially reaching over your head. With time, the tissues in the rotator cuff break down, leading to these injuries: Tendinitis . The tendons in the rotator cuff connect your muscles to your shoulder bones. In tendinitis, the tendons become irritated and swollen from being pinched during shoulder movements. Bursitis . The bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that pads the space between the rotator cuff and the bones of your shoulder. Bursitis happens when the muscle and bone rub the bursa too much. It swells with extra fluid, which causes pain Rotator cuff tears. Tears in a rotator cuff tendon can happen over time or suddenly from an injury, such as falling on an outstretched arm or lifting something heavy. A tear may go part way through a tendon (partial tear) or all the way through (full tear). Who is more likely to develop a rotator cuff injury? Anyone can develop a rotator cuff injury. But certain people are more likely to have one: People over age 40. Most rotator cuff injuries are from the wear and tear of aging. By age 80, most adults have tears. Athletes. Playing sports with repeated shoulder movements increases the risk of a rotator cuff injury, for example, tennis, swimming, and baseball - especially pitching. People in jobs that require a lot of reaching overhead or heavy lifting. Carpenters, construction workers, and painters are examples of workers who may be more likely to have rotator cuff problems. What are the symptoms of rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries don't always cause pain. But when they do, the pain is often in the top part of your arm or shoulder. You may feel more pain when you: Lie down, especially on the injured shoulder Lift your arm or lower it to the front or side Reach behind your back Other symptoms from a torn rotator cuff may include: Loss of strength in the arm Clicking or popping sounds when you move your arm How are rotator cuff injuries diagnosed? To find out if you have a rotator cuff injury, your health care provider: Will examine your shoulder. This includes checking the range of motion and where the pain is. Will test your arm and shoulder strength. May order imaging tests , such as x-rays , an ultrasound , or an MRI scan . What are the treatments for rotator cuff injuries? The best treatment for you depends on your age, how much your injury bothers you, and whether your injury was sudden or happened from wear and tear. Treatments for rotator cuff injuries often include: Rest Putting ice or a cold pack on the sore area Pain relievers to lessen pain and swelling, such as ibuprofen or aspirin Physical therapy exercises to strengthen your shoulder and improve movement A corticosteroid shot into your shoulder joint if other treatments don't help with the pain Treatments for rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis may also include ultrasound therapy. Surgery may be an option if your shoulder doesn't feel better in 6 to 12 months. Treatments for a torn rotator cuff may also include heat to the sore area or electrical stimulation of the nerves and muscles (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS).

You may enjoy having access to big, open spaces for recreation. Rural areas are less crowded and can offer more privacy. You may choose a rural area so that you can live near your family and friends. But there are also challenges to living in a rural area, including when it comes to taking care of your health. Compared to urban areas, rural communities tend to have: Higher poverty rates. A higher percentage of older adults, who are more likely to have chronic health problems. More residents without health insurance. Less access to health care. For example, clinics and hospitals may be far away. Higher rates of certain substance use, such as cigarette smoking and opioid and methamphetamine misuse. Higher rates of chronic health problems such as high blood pressure and obesity . More exposure to environmental hazards, such as chemicals used for farming. There are solutions to deal with these problems. A few examples include: Clinics offering telehealth to provide care for people who live far away from specialists or can't easily get to their providers' offices. Local public health agencies working with their communities to promote healthy living. They can provide wellness and exercise classes and start a farmer's market. Local governments adding bike lanes and trails to encourage people to bike and walk.

{"chunk_id": "7127_1", "topic_id": "7127", "topic_title": "Safe Opioid Use", "content": "What are opioids? Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain . Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose . These risks increase when opioids are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids. How do I know if I need to take opioid medicines? First, you need to talk with your provider about whether you need to take opioids. You should discuss: Whether there are other medicines or therapies that might treat your pain The risks and benefits of taking opioids Your medical history and if you or anyone in your family has a history of substance misuse, a drug addiction , or alcohol use disorder (AUD) Any other medicines and supplements you are taking How much alcohol you drink If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant What do I need to know if I am going to take opioid medicines? If you and your provider decide that you need to take opioids, make sure that you understand: How to take the medicine - how much and how often. How long you will need to take the medicine. What the possible side effects are. How you should stop the medicines when you no longer need them. If you have been taking opioids for a while, it can be dangerous to just stop suddenly. You may need to get off the medicines slowly. What the warning signs of addiction are, so you can watch for them. They include: Regularly taking more medicine than you are supposed to Taking someone else's opioids Taking the medicine to get high Mood swings, depression, and/or anxiety Needing too much or too little sleep Trouble making decisions Feeling high or sedated If you have a high risk for an overdose, you will want to get naloxone from a pharmacy and carry it with with you wherever you go. Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. How can I take my opioid medicine safely? You should always be careful when taking any medicine, but you need to take extra care when taking opioids: Take your medicine exactly as prescribed - do not take extra doses. Check the instructions every time you take a dose. Do not break, chew, crush, or dissolve opioid pills. Opioids can cause drowsiness. Do not drive or use any machinery that may injure you, especially when you first start the medicine. Contact your provider if you have side effects. If you can, use the same pharmacy for all your medicines. The pharmacy's computer system will alert the pharmacist if you are taking two or more medicines that could cause a dangerous interaction. How can I safely store and dispose opioid medicines? It is important to store and dispose of opioid medicines properly: Store your opioids and other medicines in a safe place. If you have children at home, it's a good idea to store your medicines in a lockbox. Even one accidental dose of an opioid pain medicine meant for an adult can cause a fatal overdose in a child. Also, someone who lives with you or visits your house may look for and steal your opioid medicines to take or sell them. If you travel, carry the current bottle of opioids with you for safety. This will help you answer any questions about your medicine. Dispose of your unused medicine properly. If you have unused opioid medicines at the end of your treatment, you can get rid of them by: Finding a local drug take-back program Finding a pharmacy mail-back program In some cases, flushing them down the toilet - check the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) web site to find out which ones you can flush away Never sell or share your medicines. Your prescription is for you. Your health care provider considers many factors when prescribing opioids. What's safe for you might lead to an overdose for someone else.

Scleroderma means \"hard skin.\" It's the name of an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and thickening in the skin and other areas of the body. This inflammation causes you to have areas of tight, hard skin. Scleroderma may affect just one area of your body, or it can affect many systems in your body. What are the types of scleroderma? There are two main types of scleroderma: Localized scleroderma only affects your skin and the muscles and tissues just under your skin. Systemic scleroderma, which is also called systemic sclerosis, is a more serious type. It affects many parts of your body and can damage your blood vessels and internal organs, such as your heart , lungs , and kidneys . What causes scleroderma? The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. Researchers think that several factors may play a part in causing the disease: Your genetics. Certain genes can increase the chance that you will develop scleroderma. They may also play a role in which the type of scleroderma you have. Scleroderma is not passed from parent to child, but you are more likely to develop it if a close relative has it. Your environment. Exposure to certain things in the environment, such as viruses or chemicals, may trigger scleroderma. Immune system changes . When your immune system changes, it can trigger your cells to make too much collagen in the body. Too much collagen causes patches of tight, hard skin. Hormones . Hormonal or immune system differences between women and men might play a part in the disease. Who is more likely to develop scleroderma? Anyone can get scleroderma, but certain factors may make you more likely to develop it: Your sex. Scleroderma is more common in women than in men. Your age. The disease usually appears between the ages of 30 and 50. Your race. Scleroderma can affect people of all races and ethnic groups, but the disease can affect African Americans more severely. What are the symptoms of scleroderma? The symptoms of scleroderma are different for each person, depending on the type of scleroderma you have: Localized scleroderma usually causes patches of thick, hard skin in one of two patterns: Patches in firm, oval shapes that stay in one area or spread to other areas of skin. This is called morphea. Lines of thickened or different colored skin that run down your arm, leg, and, rarely, on the forehead. This is called linear scleroderma. Systemic scleroderma can cause problems with your internal organs as well as your skin. It can cause symptoms such as: Thick, tight skin on your fingers Fatigue Raynaud's phenomenon , a narrowing of blood vessels in the hands or feet Damage to your internal organs, including your digestive system , lungs, kidneys, and heart How is scleroderma diagnosed? There is no single test for scleroderma. The symptoms can vary from person to person and can be similar to those of other diseases. This can make scleroderma hard to diagnose. To find out if you have scleroderma, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam May order blood tests, including an ANA (antinuclear antibody) test May do a skin biopsy May do other tests, such as imaging tests , to check for organ damage What are the treatments for scleroderma? There is no cure for scleroderma, but treatments can help control your symptoms and limit damage. The treatments may include: Medicines to help decrease swelling, manage pain , control other symptoms, and prevent complications. Physical or occupational therapy to help with pain, improve muscle strength, and teach you ways to help with daily living.

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency. Without quick treatment, it can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. What causes sepsis? Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Bacterial infections are the most common cause, but other types of infections can also cause it. The infections are often in the lungs, stomach, kidneys, or bladder. It's possible for sepsis to begin with a small cut that gets infected or with an infection that develops after surgery. Sometimes, sepsis can occur in people who didn't even know that they had an infection. Who is more likely to develop sepsis? Anyone with an infection could get sepsis. But certain people are more likely to develop it: Adults 65 or older People with chronic (long-lasting) conditions, such as diabetes , lung disease , cancer , and kidney disease People with weakened immune systems Pregnant women Children younger than one What are the symptoms of sepsis? Sepsis can cause one or more of these symptoms: Rapid breathing and heart rate Shortness of breath Confusion or disorientation Extreme pain or discomfort Fever , shivering, or feeling very cold Clammy or sweaty skin It's important to get medical care right away if you think you might have sepsis or if your infection is not getting better or is getting worse. What other problems can sepsis cause? Severe cases of sepsis can lead to septic shock, where your blood pressure drops to a dangerous level and multiple organs can fail. How is sepsis diagnosed? To find out if you have sepsis, your health care provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Will do a physical exam, which includes checking vital signs (your temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing) Will likely order lab tests that check for signs of infection or organ damage May order imaging tests such as an x-ray or a CT scan to find the location of the infection Many of the signs and symptoms of sepsis can also be caused by other medical conditions. This may make sepsis hard to diagnose in its early stages. What are the treatments for sepsis? It is very important to get treatment right away. Treatment usually includes: Antibiotics . Maintaining blood flow to organs. This may involve getting oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Treating the source of the infection. If needed, medicines to increase blood pressure. In serious cases, you might need kidney dialysis or a breathing tube. Some people need surgery to remove tissue damaged by the infection. Can sepsis be prevented?

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. If not treated, a STI can develop into a sexually transmitted disease (STD). STIs are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STIs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Some STIs can be passed to the fetus during pregnancy or childbirth. Other ways that some STIs may spread include while breastfeeding , through blood transfusions , or by sharing needles. There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Genital warts Gonorrhea HIV HPV Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis What causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs can be caused by bacteria , viruses , and parasites . Who is affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Most STIs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women. If an STI is passed to a fetus during pregnancy or childbirth , it can cause serious health problems. What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STIs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex. If you do have symptoms, they could include: Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or warts on the genital area Painful or frequent urination (peeing) Itching and redness in the genital area Blisters or sores in or around the mouth Abnormal vaginal odor Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding Abdominal (belly) pain Fever How are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed? If you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STIs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STIs do not usually cause symptoms. Some STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through STI testing . Some tests involve a microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STIs. What are the treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Antibiotics can treat STIs that are caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STIs caused by viruses, but antiviral medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection. It's important to get treatment if you have an STI. Some types of STIs can cause serious health problems if they are not treated. Talk to your provider about how long to not have sex after treatment to avoid passing the infection back and forth with your partner. Can sexually transmitted infections (STIs) be prevented? The surest way to protect yourself against STIs is to not have sex. If you do decide to have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by: Having you and your partner tested for STIs before having sex. Using a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If your or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Reducing your number of sex partners. You might even consider \"mutual monogamy\" with just one partner. This means that you agree to be sexually active only with them, and they agree to be sexually active only with you.

{"chunk_id": "90_1", "topic_id": "90", "topic_title": "Shingles", "content": "What is shingles? Shingles (herpes zoster) is an infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This is the same virus that causes chickenpox . After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years. But as you get older, the virus may become active again and cause shingles. Is shingles contagious? Shingles is not contagious. You cannot get shingles from someone else. But you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have direct contact with fluid from their shingles rash. The risk of spreading the virus is low if the shingles rash is kept covered. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before their rash blisters appear or after the rash crusts. Who is at risk for shingles? Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. But the risk of shingles goes up as you get older. Shingles is most common in people over age 50. People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting shingles. This includes those who: Have immune system diseases such as HIV Have certain cancers Take medicines that weaken their immune system, such as steroids and medicines you take after organ transplant Your immune system may be weaker when you have an infection or are stressed. This can raise your risk of shingles. It is rare, but possible, to get shingles more than once. What are the symptoms of shingles? Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching. It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Up to several days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash is only on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread. It might look similar to a chickenpox rash. Some people may also have other symptoms: Fever Headache Chills Upset stomach What other problems can shingles cause? Shingles can cause other problems (complications): Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is most common complication of shingles. It causes severe pain in the areas where you had the shingles rash. It usually gets better in a few weeks or months. But some people can have pain from PHN for many years, and it can interfere with daily life. Vision loss can happen if shingles affects your eye. It may be temporary or permanent. Hearing or balance problems are possible if you have shingles within or near your ear. You may also have weakness of the muscles on that side of your face. These problems can be temporary or permanent. Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia , brain inflammation ( encephalitis ), or death. How is shingles diagnosed? Usually your health care provider can diagnose shingles by taking your medical history and looking at your rash. In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing. What are the treatments for shingles? There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your provider as soon as possible. Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching. Can shingles be prevented? There is a vaccine, called Shingrix, to help prevent shingles and its complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the vaccine. Your provider might also recommend the vaccine if you are over 19 and have a weakened immune system. The vaccine is given in two doses. If you have shingles, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by: Staying away from: People with weakened immune systems People who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, especially if they are pregnant Premature or low birth weight babies Keeping the rash covered Not touching or scratching the rash Washing your hands often Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 752, "char_count": 4336, "synonyms": ["Herpes zoster", "Postherpetic neuralgia"], "mesh_terms": ["Neuralgia, Postherpetic", "Herpes Zoster"], "search_terms": ["herpes zoster", "postherpetic neuralgia", "shingles", "neuralgia, postherpetic"], "quality_score": 72.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html"},

Sjogren's syndrome, also called Sjogren's disease, is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease . When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. In Sjogren's syndrome, your immune system attacks the glands that make moisture in the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body. This causes a dry mouth and dry eyes . You may have dryness in other places that need moisture, such as your nose, throat, and skin. Sjogren's can also affect other parts of the body, including your joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, digestive organs, and nerves. What causes Sjogren's syndrome? Normally, your immune system protects the body from infection and disease. But with Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune diseases, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs. Researchers don't know for sure what causes the immune system to do this. But they think that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have linked Sjogren's syndrome to gene changes in several genes. Some researchers also think that the disease may be triggered by something in the environment. For example, they think that one possible trigger could be a previous infection with a virus or bacteria . Who is more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome? Most people with Sjogren's syndrome are women. You can get it at any age, but it is most common in people in their 40s and 50s. Sjogren's syndrome is more common in people who have other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . This is known as a secondary form of Sjogren's syndrome. People who don't have another autoimmune disease have a primary form of Sjogren's syndrome. What are the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome? Sjogren's syndrome may have different effects on the body. Not everyone will have the same symptoms. Some people have cycles of mild and then severe symptoms. The two main symptoms are: Dry eyes. Your eyes may burn or itch or feel like they have sand in them. Sometimes your vision may be blurry, or you could be bothered by bright lights. Dry mouth. Your tongue and your throat may feel dry. You might have trouble swallowing , speaking , and tasting . Sjogren's syndrome can also affect other parts of the body, causing symptoms such as: Joint and muscle pain Dry skin Rashes on the skin of hands or feet Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Vaginal dryness Dry cough that doesn't go away Fatigue that doesn't go away How is Sjogren's syndrome diagnosed? There is no single test for Sjogren's syndrome. To find out if you have it, your provider: Will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Will do a physical exam, which includes checking for signs of dry mouth and signs of related autoimmune diseases. May order tests, including: Eye tests to see if you produce a normal amount of tears and to find out if your eyes have been damaged by dryness. Salivary gland tests to measure how much saliva your mouth produces. They could include imaging tests and a biopsy . Blood tests. What are the treatments for Sjogren's syndrome? There is no cure for Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms. The treatments can be different for each person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. They may include: Eye drops (artificial tears) or ointments to relieve dryness in the eyes. Saliva substitutes. Prescription medicines that cause your salivary glands to make more saliva. A minor procedure that places small plugs the tear duct in the corners of the eyes. The plugs block your tears from draining so they stay in your eyes longer. Medicines to help with other symptoms caused by Sjogren's syndrome, such as medicines for pain and inflammation. Medicines that suppress (weaken) your immune system (for severe cases).

Sleep apnea - a breathing disorder in which you stop breathing for 10 seconds or more during sleep Restless leg syndrome (RLS) - a tingling or prickly sensation in your legs, along with a powerful urge to move them Hypersomnia - being unable to stay awake during the day. This includes narcolepsy, which causes extreme daytime sleepiness. Circadian rhythm disorders - problems with the sleep-wake cycle. They make you unable to sleep and wake at the right times. Parasomnia - acting in unusual ways while falling asleep, sleeping, or waking from sleep, such as walking, talking, or eating Some people who feel tired during the day have a true sleep disorder. But for others, the real problem is not allowing enough time for sleep. It's important to get enough sleep every night. The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. Most adults need about 7-8 hours each night. What causes sleep disorders? There are different causes for different sleep disorders, including: Other conditions, such as heart disease , lung disease , nerve disorders , and pain Mental illnesses , including depression and anxiety Medicines Genetics Sometimes the cause is unknown. There are also some factors that can contribute to sleep problems, including: Caffeine and alcohol An irregular schedule, such as working the night shift Aging. As people age, they often get less sleep or spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. They are also more easily awakened. What are the symptoms of sleep disorders? The symptoms of sleep disorders depend on the specific disorder. Some signs that you may have a sleep disorder include that: You regularly take more than 30 minutes each night to fall asleep You regularly wake up several times each night and then have trouble falling back to sleep, or you wake up too early in the morning You often feel sleepy during the day, take frequent naps, or fall asleep at the wrong times during the day Your bed partner says that when you sleep, you snore loudly, snort, gasp, make choking sounds, or stop breathing for short periods You have creeping, tingling, or crawling feelings in your legs or arms that are relieved by moving or massaging them, especially in the evening and when trying to fall asleep Your bed partner notices that your legs or arms jerk often during sleep You have vivid, dreamlike experiences while falling asleep or dozing You have episodes of sudden muscle weakness when you are angry or fearful, or when you laugh You feel as though you cannot move when you first wake up How are sleep disorders diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will use your medical history, your sleep history, and a physical exam. You may also have a sleep study (polysomnogram). The most common types of sleep studies monitor and record data about your body during a full night of sleep. The data includes: Brain wave changes Eye movements Breathing rate Blood pressure Heart rate and electrical activity of the heart and other muscles Other types of sleep studies may check how quickly you fall asleep during daytime naps or whether you are able to stay awake and alert during the day. What are the treatments for sleep disorders? Treatments for sleep disorders depend on which disorder you have. They may include: Good sleep habits and other lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and exercise Cognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety about getting enough sleep CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine for sleep apnea Bright light therapy (in the morning) Medicines, including sleeping pills. Usually, providers recommend that you use sleeping pills for a short period of time. Natural products, such as melatonin. These products may help some people but are generally for short-term use.

It harms nearly every organ of the body, even some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes many cancers and other health problems. It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States. Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include: Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus , throat , bladder , kidney , liver , stomach , pancreas , colon and rectum , and cervix . It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lung diseases . Smoking is the most common cause of COPD . It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia . Cardiovascular diseases. Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure . Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke . Vision problems . Smoking can raise your risk of cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD). You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant . Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking . What are the health risks of secondhand smoke? Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke , they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections , colds , pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma . If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight . Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous? Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes. E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals. Smokeless tobacco , such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease , and oral lesions. Why should I quit? Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen) Better circulation Less coughing and wheezing Quitting smoking can be challenging, but it is so important for your health.

{"chunk_id": "418_1", "topic_id": "418", "topic_title": "Staphylococcal Infections", "content": "What are Staphylococcal (staph) infections? Staphylococcus (staph) is a group of bacteria. There are more than 30 types. A type called Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections. Staph bacteria can cause many different types of infections, including: Skin infections , which are the most common types of staph infections. Bacteremia, an infection of the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis , a very serious immune response to infection. Bone infections . Endocarditis , an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Food poisoning . Pneumonia . Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria. What causes staph infections? Some people carry staph bacteria on their skin or in their noses, but they do not get an infection. But if they get a cut or wound, the bacteria can enter the body and cause an infection. Staph bacteria can spread from person to person. They can also spread on objects, such as towels, clothing, door handles, athletic equipment, and remotes. If you have staph and do not handle food properly when you are preparing it, you can also spread staph to others. Who is more likely to get a staph infection? Anyone can develop a staph infection, but certain people are more likely to get one, including those who: Have a chronic condition such as diabetes , cancer, vascular disease , eczema , and lung disease Have a weakened immune system, such as from HIV , medicines to prevent organ rejection, or chemotherapy Had surgery Are in the hospital Use a catheter, breathing tube, or feeding tube Have an implanted device, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint or heart valve Have burns , especially if they are deep or cover a large area of the body Are on dialysis Inject illegal drugs Do contact sports, since you may have skin-to-skin contact with others or share equipment What are the symptoms of staph infections? The symptoms of a staph infection depend on the type of infection: Skin infections can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes there is pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo , which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis , a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot. Bone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever . Endocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever , chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in your arms or legs. Food poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , and fever. If you lose too many fluids, you may also become dehydrated . Pneumonia symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn't get better. You may also have chest pain and shortness of breath . Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) causes high fever, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure. How are staph infections diagnosed? Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture , with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests , depending on the type of infection. What are the treatments for staph infections? Treatment for staph infections is antibiotics . Depending on the type of infection, the antibiotics might be a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV) medicine. If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it. Sometimes you may need surgery for bone infections. Some staph infections, such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), are resistant to many antibiotics . There are still certain antibiotics that can treat these infections. Can staph infections be prevented? Certain steps can help to prevent staph infections: Use good hygiene , including washing your hands often. Don't share towels, sheets, or clothing with someone who has a staph infection. It's best not to share athletic equipment. If you do need to share, make sure that it is properly cleaned and dried before you use it. Practice food safety , including not preparing food for others when you have a staph infection.

{"chunk_id": "4909_1", "topic_id": "4909", "topic_title": "Statins", "content": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL , is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL , is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What are statins? Statins are a type of cholesterol medicine . Your health care provider may prescribe them if you have high cholesterol and making lifestyle changes does not lower your cholesterol enough. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol. How do statins lower cholesterol? Statins lower LDL cholesterol by slowing down how much cholesterol the liver makes. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. This can slow the formation of plaques in your arteries. Studies have shown that statins lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with high LDL cholesterol. Statins can lower your triglyceride level as well. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease. Statins may also increase your HDL cholesterol. What are the risks of taking statins? Statins usually don't cause side effects , but they may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes . However, this mainly happens in people already at high risk of diabetes, such as those who are overweight or have obesity , prediabetes , or metabolic syndrome . Statins may also cause abnormal results on liver enzymes tests, but actual liver damage is very rare. Another uncommon side effect is muscle damage. In rare cases, this muscle damage can lead to muscle pain and kidney damage. You should not take statins if you are pregnant or breastfeeding . They are also not recommended for people who have certain types of liver disease . How can I safely take statins? To safely take statins, you should: Take your statin as prescribed. You should not stop taking this medicine on your own, since that can lead to a serious problem or, in rare cases, even cause death. Talk to your provider if you have any concerns about your statin or if you would like to stop or change to a different treatment. Ask your provider which other medicines, supplements , or foods you should avoid. Some of these can interact with statins and cause serious side effects or make statins less effective. For example, grapefruit (fresh or as juice) affects how your liver breaks down some statins. Tell your provider about any symptoms or side effects you are having. Sometimes, people report muscle problems while taking statins. If you start having muscle pain, your provider may order a blood test to look look for muscle damage. The pain may go away if you switch to a different statin. Muscle damage with statins is rare, and your muscles may heal when you switch to a different medicine.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 576, "char_count": 3341, "synonyms": ["HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors"], "mesh_terms": ["Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"], "search_terms": ["hmg-coa reductase inhibitors", "statins", "hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors"], "quality_score": 68.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/statins.html"},

A stillbirth can occur before or during delivery and may be considered as: Early. The loss of a fetus between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Late. The loss of a fetus between 28 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Term. The loss of a fetus at 37 or more weeks of pregnancy. What are the risk factors for stillbirth? Stillbirth can happen in any pregnancy. Some factors may increase the chance that one can occur. Risk factors can include if you: Are age 35 years or older Are of low socioeconomic status Smoke during pregnancy Have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure Are a non-Hispanic Black woman Previously had a stillbirth Are pregnant with more than one baby ( twins or triplets ) What are the possible causes of stillbirth? In many cases, the cause remains unknown. Some causes may be preventable, but most are not. Causes for a stillbirth may include: Problems with the placenta, the organ that carries oxygen and nutrients to the fetus Genetic problems with the fetus Fetal infections Other physical problems in the fetus Problems with the umbilical cord during labor and delivery How is a stillbirth diagnosed? Before delivery , the only way to diagnose a stillbirth is to check if the fetus's heart is beating. Your health care provider may use an ultrasound to look for the fetal heartbeat. During your pregnancy , your provider may recommend keeping track of fetal movements. However, if you don't notice movement, it doesn't always mean a stillbirth occurred. Sometimes, especially if it's your first pregnancy, it might be difficult to notice movement. If you're pregnant and something seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your provider. After labor and delivery , your provider will check the baby for signs of life. These can include breathing, heartbeat, voluntary movements, and pulsations in the umbilical cord. If one or more signs of life are not present, then life-saving measures are taken. If these measures are unsuccessful, a stillbirth may be diagnosed. How do health care providers manage a stillbirth? Care after a stillbirth depends on when it occurs. If it happens before delivery, your provider may induce (start) labor or use surgery to deliver the fetus ( cesarean delivery ). If it happens during labor and delivery, the placenta will still need to be removed or delivered. No matter when it occurs, losing a pregnancy can be difficult. Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you decide to try to get pregnant again, work closely with your provider to understand any risks.

{"chunk_id": "422_1", "topic_id": "422", "topic_title": "Stress", "content": "What is stress? Stress is how your brain and body respond to a challenge or demand. When you are stressed, your body releases certain hormones . Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work. The hormones that are released when you are stressed make you alert and ready to act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This response is sometimes called a \"fight or flight\" response. Everyone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something that keeps happening. Not all stress is bad. In fact, it can help you survive in a dangerous situation. For example, one kind of stress is the jolt you may feel when a car pulls out in front of you while you are driving. This jolt of hormones helps you quickly hit the brakes to avoid an accident. A little short-term stress can sometimes be helpful. For example, the stress of having a deadline for school or your job may push you to get your work done on time. Once you finish it, that stress goes away. But stress that lasts a long time can harm your health. What causes long-term stress? Long-term stress, or chronic stress, lasts for weeks, months, or longer. As you go about your life, your body is acting as if you're being threatened. Causes of long-term stress include: Routine stress from the demands of work, school, family needs, money problems, and other daily pressures that don't stop. Stress from sudden, difficult changes in your life, such as divorce, illness, losing your job, or other unhappy life events that often have a long impact. Traumatic stress, which may happen when you're in danger of serious harm or death. Examples include being in a bad accident, a war, a flood, earthquake, or other frightening event. This type of stress can cause a long-lasting problem called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How can long term-stress harm my health? People respond to stress in different ways. If you're stressed for a long time you may notice that you are: Getting sick more often than usual because stress weakens your body's ability to fight germs Having stomach problems or trouble digesting food Having trouble sleeping Having headaches Feeling sad, angry, or easily upset When stress keeps going, your body acts as if you're always in danger. That's a lot of strain that may play a part in developing serious health problems, including: Depression Anxiety Heart disease High blood pressure Diabetes It's possible to get used to the symptoms of stress and not even realize there's a problem. So when there's a lot of stress in your life, it's important to pay attention to how it affects you so you can do something about it. How can I manage long-term stress? Simple things that improve your mental health may be helpful in managing long-term stress, such as: Get regular exercise. A 30-minute daily walk can help you feel better and help keep your immune system strong, so you don't get sick. Try relaxing activities. You could look for an app or wellness program that uses breathing, meditation, or muscle relaxation exercises. Get enough sleep every night. Avoid too much caffeine . Decide what you need to do now and what can wait. And focus on what you got done each day, not on what you weren't able to do. Ask your family or friends for support. When should I ask my health care provider for help with stress? Get help if you're having severe symptoms for 2 weeks or more, including: Trouble sleeping Changes in your eating that cause unwanted changes in your weight Troubles getting out of bed because of your mood Difficulty focusing your thoughts Losing interest in things you usually enjoy Not being able to do your usual daily activities Always get help right away if stress is causing you to: Have thoughts of suicide Feel you can't cope Use drugs or alcohol more often than usual Your health care provider may refer you to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or social worker.

A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. It can help with movement, speech, strength, and daily living skills. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible. Who needs stroke rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities needed for daily life. Stroke rehabilitation is recommended for anyone affected by stroke. Most people who take part in a treatment program recover better than those who don't. The effects of a stroke depend on the parts of your brain that were affected. Your health care provider may recommend care based on your needs. The types of disabilities a stroke can cause include: Paralysis or problems controlling movement Pain or other problems with your senses Problems using or understanding language Problems with thinking and memory Difficulty with controlling or expressing emotions When should stroke rehabilitation begin? The sooner you begin rehabilitation, the more likely you are to regain lost skills and abilities. Treatment may start while you're still in the hospital. Most likely it will begin within 24 to 48 hours after the stroke. What does stroke rehabilitation include? The goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals vary for each person. Your treatment plan will depend on what part of your body or type of ability was affected by the stroke. It may include teaching you new ways to work with disabilities, such as using assistive devices to make it easier to do your usual activities. A plan for stroke rehabilitation can involve many kinds of health professionals. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and make a treatment plan. The types of treatments can include: Speech-language therapy. To help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing, and swallowing. Physical therapy. To help you relearn movement and coordination skills, regain strength, and stretch your muscles. Occupational therapy. To help improve your ability to perform daily living skills such as eating, drinking, bathing, and dressing. Cognitive therapy. To help you relearn or improve skills such as thinking, learning, memory, planning, and decision making. Mental health counseling. Therapy, medicine, or joining a patient support group may be recommended to help you cope with emotional or behavioral issues. Medicine. To treat pain, other health issues, or to help with depression or other mental health conditions following a stroke. Vocational rehabilitation. To help you build skills for going to school or working at a job. Where does stroke rehabilitation take place? Rehabilitation may start while you're in the hospital. Once you're ready for discharge, you and your family will work with your provider to determine the best setting for your specific needs. These can include: An inpatient rehabilitation clinic A home-based program An outpatient unit A skilled nursing facility How long does stroke rehabilitation last? A stroke can cause various complications, and each person may recover at a different pace. The length of rehabilitation will depend on how bad the stroke was and any related complications.

{"chunk_id": "3629_1", "topic_id": "3629", "topic_title": "Stuttering", "content": "What is stuttering? Stuttering is a speech disorder . It involves interruptions in the flow of speech. These interruptions are called disfluencies. They may involve: Repeating sounds, syllables, or words Stretching out a sound Suddenly stopping in the middle of a syllable or word Sometimes, along with the stuttering, there may be nodding, rapid blinking, or trembling lips. The stuttering may be worse when you are stressed, excited, or tired. Stuttering can be frustrating, because you know exactly what you want to say, but you have trouble saying it. It can make it difficult to communicate with people. This can cause problems with school, work, and relationships. What causes stuttering? There are two main types of stuttering, and they have different causes: Developmental stuttering is the more common type. It starts in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. Many children stutter when they first start talking. Most of them will outgrow it. But some continue to stutter, and the exact cause is unknown. There are differences in the brains of people who continue to stutter. Genetics may also play a role, since this type of stuttering can run in families. Neurogenic stuttering can happen after someone has a stroke , head trauma , or other type of brain injury . Because of the injury, the brain has trouble coordinating the different parts of the brain involved in speech. Who is at risk for stuttering? Stuttering can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls. Younger children are most likely to stutter. About 75% of children who stutter will get better. For the rest, stuttering can continue their whole lives. How is stuttering diagnosed? Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who is trained to test and treat people with voice, speech, and language disorders. If you or your child stutters, your regular health care provider may give you a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Or in some cases, a child's teacher may make a referral. To make a diagnosis, the speech-language pathologist will: Look at the case history, such as when the stuttering was first noticed, how often it happens, and in what situations it happens Listen to you or your child speak and analyze the stuttering Evaluate you or your child's speech and language abilities, including the ability to understand and use language Ask about the impact of stuttering on you or your child's life Ask whether stuttering runs in the family For a child, consider how likely it is that he or she will outgrow it What are the treatments for stuttering? There are different treatments that can help with stuttering. Some of these may help one person but not another. You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child. The plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering. Younger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed. Speech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include: Speaking more slowly Controlling breathing Gradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences For adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering. There are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression. But these medicines are not approved for stuttering, and they often have side effects.

But there are certain factors that can contribute to the risk of suicide, including: Having attempted suicide before Depression and other mental health disorders Alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of a mental health disorder Family history of an alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of suicide Family violence, including intimate partner violence , child abuse , or sexual abuse Having guns in the home Being in or having recently gotten out of prison or jail Being exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as a family member, peer, or celebrity Medical illness, including chronic pain Stressful life event, such as a job loss, financial problems, loss of a loved one, a breakup of a relationship, etc. Being between the ages of 15 and 24 years or over age 60 What are the warning signs for suicide? The warning signs for suicide include: Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill oneself Making a plan or looking for a way to kill oneself, such as searching online Buying a gun or stockpiling pills Feeling empty, hopeless, trapped, or like there's no reason to live Being in unbearable pain Talking about being a burden to others Using more alcohol or drugs Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly Sleeping too little or too much Withdrawing from family or friends or feeling isolated Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge Displaying extreme mood swings Saying good-bye to loved ones, putting affairs in order Some people may tell others about their suicidal thoughts. But others may try to hide them. This can make some of the signs harder to spot. What should I do if I need help or know someone who does? If you or someone you know has the warning signs for suicide, get help right away , especially if there is a change in behavior. If it is an emergency, dial 911. Otherwise there are five steps that you can take: Ask the person if they're thinking about killing themselves. Keep them safe. Find out whether they have a plan for suicide and keep them away from things that they can use to kill themselves. Be there with them. Listen carefully and find out what they are thinking and feeling. Help them connect to resources that can help them, such as through: Calling or texting the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988. Chatting through Lifeline Chat. For veterans, reaching the Veterans Crisis Line by: Calling 988 and then pressing 1. Texting to 838255. Chatting with them. Stay connected.

{"chunk_id": "1459_1", "topic_id": "1459", "topic_title": "Teen Sexual Health", "content": "What is teen sexual health? Teen sexual health is about how sex affects your physical and emotional health. It means knowing how to form healthy relationships and making decisions about sex that are right for you. As your body changes during puberty , how you think, feel, and interact with others also changes. You may have new feelings and thoughts about sex. Understanding who you're becoming as a sexual young adult is also part of teen sexual health. For all teens, taking responsibility for sexual health is part of growing up. Whether you choose to have sex or wait, responsibility includes knowing about: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Birth control What a healthy relationship is What are sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are caused by bacteria , viruses , and parasites that spread from person to person, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Some STIs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Without treatment, some STIs can cause long-term health problems. There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Gonorrhea HIV HPV (human papillomavirus) Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis STIs don't always cause symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection without knowing it and then pass it on to someone else. The only way to know for sure whether you have an STI is to get tested . How can I reduce my chances of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Saying \"no\" to sex is the right choice for many teens. If you decide to have sex, \"safer sex\" practices will lower your chance of getting an STI. They include: Talking with your partner about preventing STIs and getting tested before having sex. If you can't talk about STIs, you aren't ready to have sex. Getting the HPV vaccine. You can be vaccinated between ages 9 and 26. Using condoms correctly every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex: External (male) latex condoms provide the best protection against STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Internal (female) condoms, made of nitrile, are placed inside the body (vagina or anus). They may be less effective against STIs than latex external condoms. Don't use both type of condoms together because that increases the chance they'll rip Use a dental dam (a square piece of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) to protect the mouth during oral sex Having sex with only one person who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy). But first, both of you should get tested for STIs. Not mixing alcohol or drugs with sex. You need to think clearly to make safer choices about sex. How can I reduce the chance of pregnancy? The only sure way to avoid pregnancy is not to have vaginal sex. If you decide to have vaginal sex, birth control can help prevent pregnancy. There are many types of birth control that work in different ways. Your health care provider can help you choose birth control that's best for you. Condoms are the only birth control method that protects against STIs. But condoms alone aren't the most effective form of birth control. It's safest to use condoms with another form of birth control to prevent both STIs and pregnancy. What is a healthy relationship? Healthy sex starts with a healthy relationship, so it's important to take an honest look at how you and your partner treat each other. Your relationship may be healthy if it includes: Respect. You and your partner value each other's feelings. Neither of you pressure the other to do things they don't want to do. Trust and honesty. You always tell the truth and trust your partner to do the same. Good communication. You feel safe talking openly about your feelings, STIs, and other relationships. And you both listen. Your relationship may be unhealthy if it includes: Jealousy and control. One of you wants to make all the decisions and tries to keep the other from spending time with their friends and family. Disrespect. One of you makes fun of the other person's ideas and feelings. Pressure. One of you tries to bully the other into doing sexual things they don't want to do. Violence . Hitting, shoving, grabbing, and sexual assault should never be part of a relationship. If you don't know how to end a violent relationship, get help.

Testicular cancer is a cancer that develops in the tissues of one or both testicles. The testicles, or testes, are part of the male reproductive system. They make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped glands inside the scrotum, a sac of loose skin that lies below the penis. You can get cancer in one or both testicles. Who is most likely to develop testicular cancer? Testicular cancer is very rare. You can get it at any age, but it is most common in men between the ages of 20 and 39. It is also more common in those who: Have had abnormal testicle development Have had an undescended testicle, a condition in which one or both testicles fail to move into the scrotum before birth Have had testicle cancer before Have a family history of the cancer Are White What are the symptoms of testicular cancer? The symptoms of testicular cancer may include: A painless lump or swelling in either testicle A change in how the testicle feels A dull ache in the lower abdomen (belly) or the groin (the area where the thigh meets the abdomen) A sudden build-up of fluid in the scrotum Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum How is testicular cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have testicular cancer, your health care provider may use: A physical exam. Blood tests. An ultrasound of the testicles. An inguinal orchiectomy, which is a procedure to remove the entire testicle. A tissue sample from the testicle is viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. What are the treatments for testicular cancer? Testicular cancer can usually be cured.The treatment options include: Surgery (if the testicle has not already been removed during diagnosis). Radiation therapy . Chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant . Surveillance, which might be done after surgery. It means that your provider will closely follow your condition with regular exams and tests. You won't get any further treatment unless there are changes in your test results. Some of the treatments may also cause infertility . If you may want to have children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment. After you have finished your treatment, you will need regular follow-up testing to make sure that the cancer has not come back. If you have had cancer in one testicle, you have a higher risk of getting cancer in the other testicle. So it's important to check the other testicle regularly and let your provider know if you notice any changes or unusual symptoms.

There are many types of ticks in the United States, and they live in different parts of the country. Ticks can be different colors and sizes. They can be light-colored, reddish brown, or dark brown. Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk though areas where they live, such as tall grass, leaf litter or shrubs. Why do I need to be worried about tick bites? If you spend time outdoors or have pets that go outdoors, you need to beware of ticks. When they bite, certain types of ticks can pass on germs that cause different diseases. Sometimes the symptoms can be mild. In other cases, you can have serious, long-lasting health problems. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite (called tickborne diseases) include: Lyme disease Alpha-gal syndrome (tick bite red meat allergy) Babesiosis Ehrlichiosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tularemia What happens if I get bitten by a tick? You may not feel it when a tick bites you. The tick can stay attached to your body for several days. If that tick is infected, it can pass along any germs to you once it starts sucking your blood. But if you catch it and remove it before it has filled up on your blood, you are less likely to get infected. How do I remove a tick? If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove the tick as soon as you can. You could use a tick removal device or a fine-tipped tweezers: Using the tweezers, grab the tick as close to your skin as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don't twist or jerk the tick. You want to remove the whole tick in one piece if you can. If the mouth-parts of the tick break off and stay in the skin, try to remove them. But if you can't remove them easily, then leave them. Thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. When do I need to contact my health care provider about a tick bite? Many tickborne diseases can have similar signs and symptoms. The most common are: Fever Chills Aches and pains Rash If you develop any of these symptoms within several weeks of removing a tick, contact your provider. How can I prevent tick bites? There are steps you can take to prevent tick bites: Avoid wooded, brushy, and grassy areas, especially during warmer months. Wear insect repellent with DEET, picaridin or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Wear light-colored protective clothing.

The symptoms of tonsillitis include: A sore throat , which may be severe Red, swollen tonsils Trouble swallowing A white or yellow coating on the tonsils Swollen glands in the neck Fever Bad breath When does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis? You should call your health care provider if your child: Has a sore throat for more than two days Has trouble or pain when swallowing Feels very sick or very weak You should get emergency care right away if your child: Has trouble breathing Starts drooling Has a lot of trouble swallowing How is tonsillitis diagnosed? To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes. Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep. What are the treatments for tonsillitis? Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics . It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child. No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child: Gets a lot of rest Drinks plenty of fluids Tries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow Tries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat Isn't around cigarette smoke or anything else that could irritate the throat Sleeps in a room with a humidifier Gargles with saltwater Sucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them) Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin. In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy. What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one? A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she: Keeps getting tonsillitis Has bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics Has tonsils that are too big and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing Your child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 779, "char_count": 4502, "synonyms": ["Tonsil Inflammation"], "mesh_terms": ["Tonsillectomy", "Tonsillitis"], "search_terms": ["tonsil inflammation", "tonsillitis", "tonsillectomy"], "quality_score": 69.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/tonsillitis.html"},

A tremor is a neurological condition that includes shaking or trembling movements in one or more parts of your body. It most often affects the hands. But it can also affect the arms, legs, head, vocal cords, and torso (trunk). A tremor is involuntary, meaning that you cannot control it. It happens because of muscle contractions. A tremor may come and go, or it may be constant. It can happen on its own or be caused by another disorder. It is not life threatening, but it may cause challenges. It can make it hard to do daily life tasks such as writing, typing, eating, and dressing. In some cases, a tremor can even lead to disabilities . What are the types of tremor? There are several types of tremor, including: Essential tremor , sometimes called benign essential tremor or familial tremor. This is the most common type. It usually affects both your hands and arms while you are moving them. It can also affect your head, voice, or legs. Parkinsonian tremor , which is a common symptom in people who have Parkinson's disease . It usually affects one or both hands when they are at rest, but it can affect the chin, lips, face, and legs. Dystonic tremor , which happens in people who have dystonia . Dystonia is a movement disorder in which you have involuntary muscle contractions. The contractions cause you to have twisting and repetitive movements. It can affect any muscle in the body. What causes tremor? Generally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. For most types, the cause is unknown. Some types are inherited and run in families. There can also be other causes, such as: Neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis , Parkinson's disease, stroke , and traumatic brain injury Certain medicines, such as asthma medicines, chemotherapy , corticosteroids , and medicines used for certain psychiatric and neurological disorders Alcohol use disorder (AUD) or alcohol withdrawal Poisoning from certain toxic substances, including pesticides and heavy metals such as mercury and lead Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) Liver or kidney failure Anxiety or panic Too much caffeine Who is at risk for tremor? Anyone can get tremor, but it is most common in middle-aged and older adults. For certain types of tremor, having a family history raises your risk of getting it. What are the symptoms of tremor? Symptoms of tremor may include: Rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso Shaky voice Difficulty writing or drawing Problems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon How is tremor diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam, which includes checking: Whether the tremor happens when the muscles are at rest or in action The location of the tremor How often you have the tremor and how strong it is A neurological exam, including checking for: Problems with balance Problems with speech Increased muscle stiffness Blood or urine tests to look for the cause Imaging tests to help figure out if the cause is damage to your brain Tests that check your abilities to do daily tasks such as handwriting and holding a fork or cup An electromyogram , a test that measures involuntary muscle activity and how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation What are the treatments for tremor? There is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms may be so mild that you do not need treatment. Finding the right treatment depends on getting the right diagnosis of the cause. Tremor caused by another medical condition may get better or go away when you treat that condition. If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away. Treatments for tremor can include: Medicines. There are different medicines for the specific types of tremor. Another option is Botox injections , which can treat several different types of tremor.

These journal articles often become sources for news stories. They can be important tools in helping you manage your health. But it's not always easy to understand them and know what they mean for your life. For example: What you hear about a study may not explain how it fits into the bigger picture. Sometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study. That could be because the studies could have different designs and asked different questions. The news stories don't always explain this. Sometimes the studies are very small, and researchers need to do more studies to confirm the results. But the news stories about these small studies may not highlight this. So it's important to think carefully when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Here are some questions that can help you evaluate that information : Was the study in animals or humans? Getting certain results in animals may not mean that you get those same results in humans. Were the people in the study similar to you in ways that may matter, such as age, race, or sex? How big was the study? Larger studies may get more reliable results than smaller studies. How long did the study last? For example, studies testing medicines need to be long enough to show long-term benefits or risks. What kind of study was it? Clinical trials , especially randomized controlled trials, give the clearest information about whether a treatment is effective and safe in humans. In randomized controlled trials, the people in the study are randomly divided into separate groups that get different treatments. This helps prevent bias in the results. Where was the research done? If a new treatment was being tested, what were the side effects? How common were they? How do the results from the study compare with previous studies? If the new study had different results, then more studies would be needed to confirm these results. Who paid for the research? Sometimes the people paying for the research could profit financially if the study gets certain results. Who is reporting the results? Do they have a certain bias?

Uterine sarcoma is a rare, more aggressive cancer that is harder to treat. This type of cancer begins in muscle or other tissues in the uterus. Who is more likely to develop uterine cancer? Uterine cancer usually happens after menopause. The cause is unknown. However, some factors and conditions that change the balance of hormones in your body may increase your risk. These can include obesity or metabolic syndrome (a group of risk factors for certain health problems). Other factors and conditions that may increase your risk for: Endometrial cancer Taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause. Having type 2 diabetes . Starting menstruation at an early age or menopause at a later age. Having never been pregnant. Taking tamoxifen, a medicine used to prevent or treat breast cancer. Having polycystic ovary syndrome . Having a mother, sister, or daughter who has had endometrial cancer. Having certain genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome . Having endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining). Uterine sarcoma Having had past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis. Taking tamoxifen, a medicine used to prevent or treat breast cancer. What are the symptoms of uterine cancer? The most common symptom of both endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma is abnormal vaginal bleeding . Both types of uterine cancer may also cause pelvic pain or pressure, unusual vaginal discharge, or an enlarged uterus or pelvic mass. Less common symptoms may include urinating (peeing) often, having trouble urinating, or pain during sexual intercourse. How is uterine cancer diagnosed?

Suggest a biopsy or a minor procedure called dilation and curettage (D & C) to check the lining of your uterus. What are the treatments for uterine cancer? Treatment may depend on your health, how much cancer you have, and whether it has spread. The most common treatment is having a hysterectomy , which is surgery to remove the uterus. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. You may have more than one type of treatment. Other treatments may include: Hormone therapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Can uterine cancer be prevented? There is no sure way to prevent uterine cancer.

{"chunk_id": "7667_1", "topic_id": "7667", "topic_title": "Vaccine Safety", "content": "What are vaccines? Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria . Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ. These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity. These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. Do vaccines cause side effects? As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue , or mild fever . They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease. Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction . Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD. How are vaccines tested for safety? Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.: First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people. Testing with people is done through clinical trials . In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers. The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it? During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA. After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved: The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety. The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines. These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.", "chunk_number": 1, "word_count": 691, "char_count": 4141, "synonyms": [], "mesh_terms": ["Vaccines", "Vaccines", "Vaccines"], "search_terms": ["vaccine safety", "vaccines"], "quality_score": 75.0, "source_url": "https://medlineplus.gov/vaccinesafety.html"},
{"chunk_id": "294_1", "topic_id": "294", "topic_title": "Vaccines", "content": "What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses , like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria , including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This \"memory\" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important? Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule.

The vagina is the canal leading from your cervix (the opening of your uterus) to the outside of your body. Who is more likely to develop vaginal cancer? You are more likely to develop vaginal cancer if: You're age 60 or older. You've had certain types of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infections. You were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages. DES was later linked to different health problems, including vaginal cancer. You have had abnormal cells in your vagina , cervix , or uterus . What are the symptoms of vaginal cancer? Vaginal cancer often doesn't have early symptoms. However, see your health care provider if you notice: Vaginal bleeding that is not your period A vaginal lump Pelvic pain Pain during sex Pain while urinating (peeing) Constipation or blood in your stool (poop) or urine (pee) How is vaginal cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have vaginal cancer, your provider will use tests that examine the vagina and other organs in your pelvis. These tests may include: A pelvic exam . Your provider may also do a Pap test and/or an HPV test during your pelvic exam. Colposcopy , a procedure to examine your cervix, vagina, and vulva. Biopsy , a procedure to remove some cells so they can be checked for cancer. What are the treatments for vaginal cancer? Vaginal cancer can often be cured if it is found early. Treatments for vaginal cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy , and/or chemotherapy . Can vaginal cancer be prevented?

The walls of the capillaries are thin and leaky, to allow for an exchange of materials between your tissues and blood. Vascular diseases are conditions which affect your vascular system. They are common and can be serious. Some types include: Aneurysm - a bulge or \"ballooning\" in the wall of an artery Atherosclerosis - a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Blood clots , including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease , diseases that involve the narrowing or blockage of an artery.

It is a permanent form of birth control . A vasectomy works by cutting the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry the sperm out of the testicles. Then the sperm can no longer reach the semen. Semen is the fluid that the penis ejaculates (releases during orgasm). Since there are no sperm, the man cannot get a woman pregnant. The surgery is quick; it usually takes less than 30 minutes. You will probably be able to go home the same day. You may have some discomfort, bruising, and swelling for a few days. In most cases, you will fully recover in less than a week. A vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. But it takes about three months (or about 20 ejaculations) before it is effective. You will still need to use other birth control until you know that your semen doesn't have any more sperm in it. After two to three months, your health care provider will test your semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it. Having a vasectomy does not affect your sex life. It does not decrease your sex drive. And it will not affect your ability to get an erection or have an orgasm. Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed, but not always. It is done with a procedure to reconnect the vas deferens. Another option if you decide to have children later might be to have sperm taken from your testicles. The sperm could then be used for in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, this may not always work. It's also important to know that both a vasectomy reversal and IVF are expensive.

They are made of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) inside of a protein coating. There are a huge number of viruses on earth. Only a small number of them can infect humans. Those viruses can infect our cells, which may cause disease. Some of the diseases that viruses can cause include the common cold , the flu , COVID-19 , and HIV . How are viruses spread? Viruses can be spread in different ways: Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes. By touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy . Through contaminated food or water . By being bitten by an infected insect or animal. Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection. How do viruses cause disease? Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells. They then use those cells to multiply (make copies of themselves). This process is also called replication. The process can kill, damage, or change the infected cells. Sometimes this can make you sick. The symptoms can range from mild to very severe. Other times, your immune system may be able to fight it off and you may not have any symptoms. Each different virus usually only infects one type of cell in your body. For example, hepatitis viruses affect the cells in the liver. HIV infects a certain type of immune system cell. What are the treatments for viral infections?

Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease . What is VLDL cholesterol? VLDL stands for very-low-density lipoprotein. Your liver makes VLDL and releases it into your bloodstream. The VLDL particles mainly carry triglycerides , another type of fat, to your tissues. VLDL is similar to LDL cholesterol , but LDL mainly carries cholesterol to your tissues instead of triglycerides. VLDL and LDL are sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterols because they can contribute to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis . The plaque that builds up is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. It can lead to coronary artery disease and other heart diseases . How do I know what my VLDL level is? There isn't a way to directly measure your VLDL level. Instead, you will most likely get a blood test to measure your triglyceride level. The lab can use your triglyceride level to estimate what your VLDL level is. Your VLDL is about one-fifth of your triglyceride level. However, estimating your VLDL this way does not work if your triglyceride level is very high. What should my VLDL level be? Your VLDL level should be less than 30 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Anything higher than that puts you at risk of heart disease and stroke . How can I lower my VLDL level? Because VLDL and triglycerides are linked, you can lower your VLDL level by lowering your triglyceride level. You may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight, changing your diet, and getting exercise. It is important to switch to healthy fats and cut back on sugar and alcohol.

In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit . The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing. Whooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital. What causes whooping cough? Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth. If you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious. What are the symptoms of whooping cough? The symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later. Whooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include: Runny nose Mild fever Mild, occasional cough The early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue. If this happens, get medical care for your baby right away. As whopping cough gets worse, the symptoms may include: Fits of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound Vomiting during or after coughing fits Exhaustion after coughing fits The coughing fits get worse and start happening more often, especially at night. You may have them for up to 10 weeks or more. Recovery from this can happen slowly. Your cough gets milder and happens less often. The coughing fits can come back if you have another respiratory infection, even months after you first got whooping cough. How is whooping cough diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose whooping cough : A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam A lab test which involves taking a sample of mucus from the back of the throat through the nose. This may be done with a swab or syringe filled with saline. The sample is tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough. Blood test Chest x-ray What are the treatments for whooping cough? The treatment for whooping cough is usually antibiotics. Early treatment is very important. It may make your infection less serious and can also help prevent spreading the disease to others. Treatment after you have been sick for 3 weeks or longer may not help. The bacteria are gone from your body by then, even though you usually still have symptoms. This is because the bacteria have already done damage to your body. Whooping cough can sometimes be very serious and require treatment in the hospital. Can whooping cough be prevented? Vaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough. There are two vaccines in the United States that can help prevent whooping cough: DTaP and Tdap. These vaccines also provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria . Babies and other people at high risk serious disease should be kept away from people who have whooping cough. Sometimes health care providers give antibiotics to family members of people who have had whooping cough or people who have been exposed to it. The antibiotics may prevent them from getting the disease. You may also help prevent the spread of whooping cough (and other respiratory diseases) by: Washing your hands often with soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available.
